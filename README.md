# Text-and-Social-Analytics-Project

With a large amount of data generated by social media platforms, text analytics provides an effective way to conduct market research on product branding and reputation. This project involves the collection, cleaning, and analyzing of textual data.

This project is done mainly on Jupyter notebooks. There are HTML files attached for easy reference.

## Result and Insights/Recommendations

### Text Sentiment Classification
![classification_result](https://github.com/exfang/Text-and-Social-Analytics-Project/assets/98097965/3097f612-0827-4676-99af-55dc0dd934bc)

The best model, Logistic Regression, classification is good with majority (92.29%) of the the texts being correctly classified. Meanwhile, the false positive and negative rate is low at only 7.70%.

An ROC value of 0.5 represents a random guess, while a value of 1 represents a perfect model that perfectly separates positive and negative classes. A value of 0 represents a model that performs worse than random guessing. The classification has a high ROC_AUC score of 92.29%, which is roughly 7.71% away from being a perfect model. Therefore, Logistic Regression is the best model for classifying scraped text data.

Looking at the top 10 words used to classify a text into the positive sentiment, the words are mostly emotion words. This explains why the text is able to perform well since emotion words occur commonly in texts.

![top_negative_keywords](https://github.com/exfang/Text-and-Social-Analytics-Project/assets/98097965/915f490c-946b-4442-8401-97dc02409a77)

These are the top 10 features that are mostly used to classify a text to the negative sentiment. The terms are mostly adverbs/adjectives such as 'horribl' and 'rude'. Therefore, adjectives/adverbs are necessary in sentiment analysis.

This also shows how well the Logistic Regression classifier learns from the data as all the terms used to classify the positive/negative sentiments in the model are correct terms used to determine the sentiment of a text from a human's perspective.

In addition, some of the negative aspects of DisneyLand could be identified from the keywords used to classify a text to the negative sentiment. This includes the terms: 'monei', 'rude', 'hour and wast', 'disappoint'.

These are all negative aspects of DisneyLand.

Monei, or money, could refer to the prices of items in DisneyLand. The prices in DisneyLand are typically higher compared to outside DisneyLand which may cause customers to feel unhappy. Although DisneyLand needs to make an income, they could consider lowering the price to balance their profit with customer satisfaction.

'rude' could refer to the service staff in DisneyLand. Management at DisneyLand could consider supervising and monitoring how their staff interact with their customers to identify the issues. They could also reach out to customers who experience rude services and understand and resolve the issue.

'disappoint' could refer to the facilities or services at DisneyLand. Especially after the pandemic, some facilities might not have been maintained and may be broken or closed. Management could consider conducting periodic check ups on their facilities to prevent customers from encountering broken or closed facilities which may affect their experience.

'hour and wast' could refer to wasted hour in waiting for some services at DisneyLand due to overcrowding. DisneyLand is a popular tourist attraction and crowd control may be a problem. Waiting long hours for a service may cause unhappiness and unsatisfaction among visitors. Therefore, management needs to learn how to handle the crowd to reduce customer waiting time.

### Text Topic Modelling

![Topic Coherence Score](https://github.com/exfang/Text-and-Social-Analytics-Project/assets/98097965/3931295b-0950-4b5c-979e-6d8cf0d16666)
Topic coherence looks at a set of words in generated topics and rates the interpretability of the topics. The higher the value, the better the model, and the more interpretable the topics are.

Since 5 topics has the highest coherence score of 0.3972, I decided to go into details of the 5 topics.

![Individual Topics](https://github.com/exfang/Text-and-Social-Analytics-Project/assets/98097965/c924a9a4-fc36-4b41-b938-baf5917fe4ab)

Looking at the individual topic and their terms, the topics are not very clear. These are the topics I assume it to be:

- Topic 0: Rude Service
- Topic 1: Themes
- Topic 2: Costs
- Topic 3: War
- Topic 4: Customer Recommendation

From these identified topics, DisneyLand could consider reviewing their staff's attitude and approach to managing their customers. By identifying and correcting the way staffs manage their customers, DisneyLand could potentially improve their customer's experience and satisfaction level, leading to higher chances of custome rrecommendations.
