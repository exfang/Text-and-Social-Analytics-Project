0,"There's an undeniable magic to Disneyland. I mean, they literally infuse the smell of homemade cookies on Main Street. There's an atmosphere and vibe that is difficult to replicate anywhere else, especially if you are a fan of Disney's entertainment.Some personalities may not enjoy the long-line waiting, buying tons of merchandise, and the exorbitant prices of tickets (or food inside the park). Price is a huge thing. Is it worth it? That will be up to the individual to decide. I think if you are going with children aged 6-12 it could be incredibly ""magical"" to watch them experience Disneyland, enjoy the rides, meet some of their favorite characters, etc. If you are going with only other adults, it may be best to make sure that everybody is a fan of Disney - because otherwise it may provide a lackluster experience and it may be better to go to a roller-coaster focused theme park. If you are going with extended family, hope to the universe that whoever is getting fast-passes for you gets it for a ride you like because you likely don't have much of a say in anything.Overall, you are going to get your money's worth and have an enjoyable time, for sure. This is Disney's biggest money maker. It brings in more money (the theme parks in general) than basically any other portion of their business, and they own a ton. If you want to go and can afford it, it's worth experiencing at least once in your life - possibly more if you fall in love with it.",4/5,9 months ago on  Google
1,"We went for one day and tickets cost $164 each. Parking was $30, in which we also purchased ahead of time. Definitely plan ahead. We purchased a week and a half before our trip and although it wasn't the day we originally planned, everything worked out. My teens first Disneyland visit and they had fun. The only downside was waiting in line for the rides. Definitely get the Genie Service,  it's only $20 per ticket, which I somehow mistaken the price. We arrived by 9am and waited for parking for about 15 minutes. Then walked towards the tram and did the security clearance [bag check, metal detector]. The tram was quick and they had multiple going at a time, back and forth, so the wait was less than 10 minutes. We were on the Disneyland Park side, so we walked and enjoyed the day there [was there for about 9 hours]. We didn't stay for the parade or fireworks. By the end of the day, the sun was too much. After being there all day, we realized it's better to go just before the sun sets, less sun exposure, shorter lines. Merchandise and food was definitely pricey. We will be back but for California's Adventure.",5/5,3 months ago on  Google
2,Fantastic! Still the great Disneyland that I remember since I was a kid. Great rides and attractions plus the crowd control seems to be a little better (didn’t feel like I had to wait hours for rides). The app was helpful though could definitely be improved. And I do recommend getting genie+ if you wanna get on rides without the wait (definitely worth it.,5/5,a week ago on  Google
3,"What a beautiful place to have fun.If you go on a weekday, you will still be able to take a lot of good photos. If you go on weekends there will be more fun activities.In terms of buying tickets, you should buy tickets in advance to enjoy special offers or promotions or dresses for children and the elderly.Public transportation is also very convenient, you just need to search on Google map or ask anyone to go here very easily. We had genie but still we had to wait for long time and at some point we weren’t able to make reservation. If you on a busy day Genie not make any help. In all great experience",5/5,4 months ago on  Google
4,"This was an amazing experience that we enjoyed in the rain and cold weather, we got the genie app and lightning lanes which helped out immensely. With the app we were able to see real time waits for ride lines couple days before, and schedule accordingly on the days that we were there. You can also search anything, like restrooms and restaurants. We were able to book walk up appointments for some of the restaurants and also mobile order food and coffee at some locations. This was very convenient while managing our time between meals attractions or  shows........",5/5,11 months ago on  Google
5,"Amazing experience every time we go. The new Star Wars was better than expected. It felt so real! There’s always a crowd but well worth it! Loved the Star Wars Rise of the Resistance ride, it really felt like entering the Empire’s ship. The smugglers run was also enjoyable. The park was clean and well maintained. Using the app made planning the day easier. We also used the water refill stations throughout the park. Mobile ordering was easy and faster than standing in the line. Overall awesome experience and of course we will be back!",5/5,a year ago on  Google
6,"I can see why so many people find this place to be the happiest place on earth. It is way better than Disney World. Come at me bro! The late January visit with two kids was beyond magical. The experience as an adult was way more pleasant than I thought it would be. Please do prep before hand with the app. In fact do everything on the app and save any grief. Genie plus was worth it during the busy days, but if you are lucky to miss the crowds you can have a great time without it. I didn’t think I would say this but I will be back in a couple of years. I need to save a small fortune again to visit.",5/5,10 months ago on  Google
7,Had a fantastic time here. The Star Wars exhibit is phenomenal and walking around the rest of the park is a visual treat as well. The attention to detail is amazing. The amount of staff they have working to keep the customer experience pleasant is overwhelming. Highly recommend this as a staycation for us living in Southern California.,5/5,7 months ago on  Google
8,I love Disney! I know this is suppose to be a kids place but one must admit it is truly the happiest place on earth. I have been to Disney several times yet each time seems like the first. My daughters love all the parks but the Incredible ride is the winner! We must have gotten on at a minimal of 10x and it was not enough. Disney is nicely decorated and there is so much to see that the lines don't even bother you. With the California weather in the 70s it was another perfect visit.

9,"We went to Disneyland on a Thursday, which was still busy, but I definitely think better than going on the weekend. We only went to the main park as well because the other park (Adventure Park) was all sold out. Overall, the park was really fun, especially for adults. I never felt bad on any of the rides. They were all smooth, never rough like going to another amusement park. Additionally, they have some interactive rides like those from the Star Wars Section. However, I definitely recommend going more than one day so you can do everything and even visit the other park. Overall, I really enjoyed my time at Disneyland and it’s truly a place for all ages. Additionally, the firework show was amazing!",5/5,3 months ago on  Google
10,"Amazingly enough, walking in the Childhood Story Land, seeing things that seemed to be a dream or a movie is an unique experience almost beyond our wildest dreams, where the line between real life and made up story is very subtle and imagination meets the tangible. Photos and videos may express a little, but the real experience of the visit is unforgettable. Still the visit is quite expensive and a full experience cannot be completed in a day or two.",5/5,11 months ago on  Google
11,"If you like theme parks Disneyland is a must. Even if you don’t like theme parks Disneyland is worth checking out. It’s very entertaining for both children and adults and there is plenty of rides, food, special events for you to enjoy yourself. Even if you don’t get a genie plus pass lines move fairly quickly and the staff is super friendly. I’d recommend checking out the new rise of the resistance ride they recently set up. Good times to be had at Disneyland.",5/5,8 months ago on  Google
12,"Amazing experience with my family. My kids love it! I recommend going to the park right as it gets open at 8am, especially if you don't have the Fast Pass, there aren't too many people in line for the rides then and you get to go on more rides. Just be prepared to walk for miles and miles throughout the day and to be standing for long periods of time. If there's little ones attending, I would definitely recommend bringing strollers. Everything was worth it though. Happiest place on earth.",5/5,2 weeks ago on  Google

14,Not the same as it used to be. Not buying Genie + will make you spend a lot of time in lines and for some attraction you will even have to pay  and extra individual lightning lane to ride them. To have an estimated they let 15 people from stand by line for every 60 lightning lane being said that they have priority. So in order to have a great day is recommended to buy genie + or be relaxed to wait a lot for attractions. Remember to book in advance your ticketsHope that fast passes come back 🥲,4/5,a month ago on  Google
15,"I’ve been a long time Disney regular. Me and my family go every other week or so with our magic keys, and before with the annual passes.This park is really the best experience a family can ask for. The different areas, foods, themes, characters is just endless! Even after going for so many years we still come across surprises.Our family loves Disneyland and we pretty much built a large amount of our experiences at this park. I am grateful for the magic 🏰 🪄",5/5,4 months ago on  Google
16,It’s best place to enjoy the memories of childhood.. best experience so far.. the adventure rides are just so amazingly designed. I really loved the space mountain and Star Wars : rise of resistance. Another one that completely shook me was a beautiful boat ride into,5/5,11 months ago on  Google
17,"Great Trip!We had a great trip to Disney for my graduation. The parks were really crowded, so have purchase the lightning lane which save enough time to enter most of the rides, the employees were nice and the parks were so clean. People were cleaning and painting the entire time we were there. Very impressive to keep parks with that many people clean. I made a mistake not preparing ahead of time, if you are visiting this place, try to prepare ahead of time, there is an app available to check for activity and the wait time, by just having the app alone will save you a lot of precious time. Instead of standing in line to order food, i click on the app and waited 20 mins while many people are still waiting in line. Don't worry too much and make sure you have enough sleep and energy for all the fun.",5/5,4 months ago on  Google
18,I mean what can I say but wow! I'm very impressed. The only thing that sucks is the long lines but the atmosphere makes up for that.

See u tomorrow Disneyland California adventure,5/5,6 months ago on  Google
19,"Went on a family trip and we loved every minute of it. Now for the mothers who love to save a penny or 3, pack a lunch for the kids. You won’t regret it. Get an electric wheelchair if you have to because there will be a ton of walking. Trust me.",5/5,2 months ago on  Google
20,"It’s one great experience to go to Disneyland, plenty of rides for anyone, small kids, thrill seekers, star wars fans. Many good food options, the park is pretty clean too. Staff is helpful and kind. The fireworks show (which is on select nights) exceeded my expectations. If you have time and money, and are nearby, Disneyland is a must.",5/5,10 months ago on  Google
21,"Such a fun place for both kids and adults, but just that it’s too crowded. Maybe due to the Halloween season. We had to wait in a long line to take picture with Minnie and didn’t get to take picture with other characters. The shuttle bus from the parking lot was also a long wait. We have to always look into the app and check the waiting time. But still, it is very entertaining and unforgettable experience.",5/5,2 months ago on  Google
22,"Local tip: Go on a Wednesday, it’s a bit cheaper, less crowded and best on a rainy day! Planned a visit in  December of 2019, just weeks  before the covid pandemic and this was my last “normal trip” to Disneyland. Make sure to buy your ticket and parking pass before your visit. If it’s within the budget buy the guided tour and  divide the cost between the adults.",5/5,8 months ago on  Google
23,"Pros: I was here in late September, so the park wasn’t too crowded, but there were still lots of people. I paid for a 3-day park hopper and didn’t have to pay extra to get on rides. I was able to do all the rides, see shows, and did everything I wanted to do in both parks within 3 days.Cons: I was here 20 years ago, and the same magic is no longer here. I would say that my experience was underwhelming for the price I have already paid for. Many rides are old and dusty. No parades, but there’s a Fantasmic. Not that many opportunities to do characters meet and greet. Some people need to pay extra to get on rides and take pictures with the characters which add up pretty quickly. Almost everything must be done through an app that tracks your information. Universal Studios has done a better job than Disney.",4/5,3 months ago on  Google

It is really an amazing experience for all ages, no matter if it‘s an adult or kids. Definitely recommend and everyone should have done this at least once in their lifetime. Even if you are not a huge Disney fan, you should definitely check it out!",5/5,3 weeks ago on  Google
27,"Amazing park. All old Disney style cast members, full of love and knowledge. I was happy to hear that the law in California made Disney keep their jobs. It’s a better experience than in Disney World in Florida since the laid off all old staff and hired a lot of rude cast members to replace old employees in Orlando.

32,"I have been coming here since I was 3 years old. I am almost 45. It only seems to get better. I was however disappointed with the new lightning line system. You can only reserve one line at a time and after 10 am you can forget about a ride less then 2 hours out for a lightning line reservation. If you stand in line for a regular wait time your looking at 1 hour minimum. As far as the views and shows and smiles on the children's faces go, we'll that is priceless. I pray I will be able to return here for the next 30 plus years and hopefully by then they will have mastered a way to speed up the lines.

34,"Another great 👍 park to visit. This was day two of our park hopping while in Cali. Personally I enjoyed the Disneyland side more than I did the California Adventure Park but for some it’s the other way around. For me I guess I was more familiar with some of the themes in Disneyland which made me feel right at home versus having the ask the kiddos what is that, or what movie was that 😂Again both are great parks and you really can’t go wrong with either. This was just another great chance to create memories with the ones I ❤️",5/5,6 months ago on  Google
35,"God Bless 🙌🏽 this magical place. Perfect for lil ones. I took my 5 year old here for summer ☀️ Vacation and we were blown away. The rides, the attractions, the fireworks, the night electric parade. Everything was perfect. Worth every penny. We spent the whole day there. Started at  ""rope drop"" and left after fireworks 🎆 bring a stroller because the walking is brutal. A portable fan is a MUST! By 2pm the heat 🔥 is crazy. Food is extremely affordable. The gift shops have good air conditioning to cool down...lol. love love love this amusement park. Definitely check it off your bucket list.",5/5,3 months ago on  Google
36,"Just spent two days at Disney and one in California Adventure.It’s changed a lot over the years, but those changes are for the better and maintains the charm I found as a child.Don’t focus on the costs as you can’t and don’t want to put a price on making memories.  We had fun and took a lot of pictures.Genie pass was worth the cost as you can cut down on wait times at the most popular rides except Star Wars, that is a separate $20.00, but again we’ll worth it.  We didn’t spend that much time waiting in lines, in the heat.",5/5,4 months ago on  Google
37,"I love Disneyland BUT the amount of strollers is ridiculous. You can barely walk in certain areas because it is FULL of stroller parking.  I've read reviews that food had gone downhill since post pandemic and I have to agree. Also I've never seen a difference in the crowd volume since reservations were implemented. Cast Members do not have the happy attitude they once did. But on the positive side, I do love Halloween and Christmas time there. Lots of great photo ops.",4/5,a month ago on  Google
38,"Loved this place, truly is magical. Walking through Star Wars area is like being on a movie set. Lines were not too crazy for the most part. The app to see your location and ride wait times is PRICELESS, A MUST HAVE download and use it. You can also pre order food via this app which is an amazing time saver. Staff are beyond belief sincere, helpful, kind. Went for two days, should shoot for three and you would probably be able to ride every ride. Jambalaya is the BOMB! You can get it in New Orleans Square. Definitely cannot  miss canoeing on their mini river, my 7 year old thought it great fun. I could go on and on, but if you have the opportunity,  GO!!!",5/5,11 months ago on  Google

When you go there with 3 persons, eat something, drink something, do a speed pass for a single attraction and buy a souvenir, you end up at about 750 dollars.Having said that, it was still worth the money, we had a great day!",5/5,5 months ago on  Google
41,Came here with family. Disneyland park is always a great experience for me at least. Especially with the COVID-19 pandemic the wait for the lines isn't so bad. The popular rides are a little more of a wait to be honest. The coffee cold brew by star wars was really great and tasty. I would recommend getting it I have it here in one of the photos but forgot the name of it. The Uber pick-up and drop off was super convenient since I had to leave my family a little earlier due to going to work around 7pm. Every staff member is so friendly and willing to help! I forgot to mention when you arrive the tramp isn't working but it's only a 20min walk to the main entrance of the park.

It really is magical as soon as you step foot on property. I feel transported into another reality and completely forget about the outside world. We went on Wednesday during the Halloween season so all of the decorations were up. A lot of new cool things to see and editions for the Holiday. The food is always great and the rides are amazing. This time I visited was busier than normal and even though we had the genie plus we still had to wait a little longer than normal.

Of these, I especially enjoy the Matterhorn bobsleds, Haunted Mansion, and Thunder Mountain railroad (which were added later but are still relatively vintage).  Other, newer rides like Splash Mountain and the Star Wars rides live up to expectations.  The electric parade has returned and should not be missed!  In terms of dining, the Blue Bayou Terrace was a good experience.",5/5,4 months ago on  Google

Food is allowed. You can bring in your food, like snacks and drinks.3. The Disneyland app will be your friend for knowing wait time estimates for rides.4. Check the app for showtimes; the Fantasmic show is fantastic!5. There is security, and they check thoroughly. They also have cops with dogs.6. Be ready for lots of walking.

50,8/10. The most magical place on Earth has really lost all of its magic.🥺 We visited last Saturday and by 9am it had already seemed like the park had reached capacity by the amount of people that were in the park at one time. Even with Disney Gene we waited hours to get on every ride and barely got to eat. It seems that even though Disney was trying to limit guests by making reservations but it feels like they don't even look at the amount of people that are coming into the parks each day. It was so incredibly crowded we left at 4pm because we were like sardines in a can. Really hoping Disneyland will gain back some of the magic soon.❤️,4/5,2 months ago on  Google
51,Weekends get very crowded so it was worth it to get the Genie Pass to get Lightning Lane (Fast Passes) to skip the line on the most popular rides. Most rides has 50 min and above time but with the Genie pass we only had to wait between 10-20min a ride. The day we went was also Dapper Day so that may be why it was more crowded than expected on a weekend.,5/5,2 months ago on  Google

57,"We celebrated our 1st anniversary at Disneyland. I hadn’t been in over ten years, so there were many incredible sights and shops. However, the new Star Wars attraction was not worth waiting in line for over 2 hours. The detail and design are fantastic, but the ride primarily walks through several rooms with audio and video effects. When you get to the actual ride is a moving cart holding nine riders and shifts from room to room with lots of audio and video along with cool holograms, but other than that, there is little “ride effect” if you're a die-hard SW fan. Like a ship-like experience, then you'll probably enjoy it. The attraction, to me, didn't justify the 2 1/2 hour wait.",5/5,3 months ago on  Google

59,"Caught the very tail end of the holiday season lights and, despite the crowds, had a wonderful time. There’s nothing quite like Disneyland when you’ve got kiddos in your group. The huge downside of course is the lightening lane (the kiddos in our group called it the privilege lane) which is essentially the easiest way to charge ridiculous amounts of money for something that already costs ridiculous amounts of money. Just casually reestablishing economic classism to the detriment of a vast majority of individuals present ✌️",4/5,6 months ago on  Google
60,"Breaks my heart to leave this review, but we are done with Disneyland. After many years of being the ""crazy Disney fans"" we will no longer be going back. Prices have risen so high, the sizes of all of the food has shrunken so much, quality is so so low now, crowds are almost unbearable even for us, and the magic is gone. They are charging for every single last possible thing they can, adding so much unexpected extra cost to your trip. We felt like we had to pay for all of the extra things in order to make our trip worth it. Employees were so incredibly unhappy and treated the guests terribly often. We were in shock to just how many ""ornery"" employees we witnessed. This says a lot about how disgusting Disney has become, because they are more unhappy than ever before. We genuinely felt the whole time that we paid so much money to listen to employees yell, and I mean literally YELL at children for not properly wearing masks. It was awful. We no longer feel right supporting a company that does not care for it's employees and is becoming one of the most greedy/money hungry companies on the planet. Disney needs to drastically change things or they will continue losing the magic and guests just won't return, even hardcore ones like us. We never believed we would be the ones to not be going back.As you can see in our photos we still managed to enjoy our trip. We are happy that we were able to have one more (very very expensive) magical trip with once in a lifetime experiences....buuut cya later Disney, we are excited to give our money to and support GOOD companies from now on.",1/5,10 months ago on  Google
61,The park itself is great. The wait times and crowds are the only thing I don't like. I wish there was a 4.5 star I could give. I understand there is nothing to fix that without drastically limiting admission and thereby preventing many people from ever experiencing Disneyland. There were some technical difficulties on a couple rides while we were there and that was disappointing but it happens. Better to be safe. I LOVE the Galaxy's Edge area!

Bring a backpack,snacks, hat, sunglasses, mini fan, water bottle if you plan on staying all day. You can snack in line for rides. Mobile app wait times are pretty accurate.

66,Always great fun to be had at Disney. When you see the fresh fruit vendor it is a good idea to buy an extra (for me!). Harder to find later on and the fresh fruit is refreshing.

You will definitely have fun at this place.Pros:- fun rides- Genie pass- huge variety of shops and food choices-parade, fire works- everything is so much fun!Cons:-long wait times (even with the Genie pass..  you can only reserve a spot for 2 or 3 rides at a time. If you try to reserve more it'll tell you to wait a few hours)-expensive (lemonade is $4.99 USD and half the cup is ice).

70,"Disneyland is amazing! My family and I prefer Disneyland over California Adventures but that doesn’t mean we don’t appreciate California Adventures- we make time for both parks on any given day.We have the Magic Key and for us there’s a few things we noticed;Indiana Jones’ Adventure is best enjoyed if you sit in the back of the jeep (If you are average or above average height- otherwise others, especially small children would probably enjoy riding in the front for viewing purposes.) because you feel the ruggedness more and you get a better view along the ride.Space Mountain is best enjoyed if you sit in the front because you really feel the throttle that much more.If you are facing the Matterhorn bobsleds, the line on the left will land you in the bobsleds that are seemingly more jerky and for us that’s more fun!Also, If you can spend the money I also recommend building your very own lightsaber at Savi’s Workshop. It’s worth it.Obviously there’s so much you can do, eat and drink at Disneyland and this is only a glimpse of what it has to offer and everyone has their own thoughts and feelings on what their “favorites” are but this was a short note from my family and I.Overall, we enjoy everything about Disneyland and I’m sure you do/will too.",5/5,9 months ago on  Google

The down side is that not even in this magical world you get things easily like, you have to wait 30min avg to go in a ride for 1 min and the amount of money you spend with ticket, parking, food and merch is kinda salty.

78,"First time with a 10 month old. We went on March 18th, 2022. A couple of key points to make your trip more efficient (especially with a little one):1. Get the preferred parking, it saves a lot of time and walking.2. Be there at open and target all the rides in fantasy land, Peter pan line fills up immediately so scratch that one off the list (the idea of going to the flagship rides like star wars, etc... is not efficient in my opinion).3. Get genie + for 20 bucks, it saved us soooo much time. Haunted mansion had a 70+ minute wait, we were able to skip that line and only wait 10 mins or so. This is especially important when you have little ones.4. The genie + will give you a time for example, 4:20pm for journey. Do not be late for those, that time is given to all lightning lane/genie + ticket holders. So if you arrive at 4:30 you'll see a huge line in the genie + lane. Be there 10 mins early for popular rides.5. Bengal barbecue was awesome. Freshly made, great food. Would recommend that spot.6. The baby care centers are great, the one in disneyland located on main street was great for changing and feeding,  a place to sit for dads and away from the crowds. The one in California adventure is not as good.7. Bring food, you're allowed top, snacks and drinks saved us time and money. And we were able to feed our baby in wait lines.8. Familiarize yourself with the app, plan your trip ahead, and watch some YouTube videos. The trip costs a lot, so might as well be prepared and get the most out of it. I wish I was better able to navigate the app before arriving.9. We saw a lot of people jump lines, enter from the handicap gate for rides, or have these blue/yellow cards (I'm assuming because of disabilities). However, I guess if you mention any condition like IBS or anxiety they give you these cards. We didn't do this but a few of the people I spoke to do, so if you are not big on ethics you can use this route as well.10. At the end when you're leaving and if you arrive in one of those shuttles make sure you walk ALL the way down. People crowd right in the middle and wait forever, walk all the way down.11. Bring a big jogger/stroller so you can store all your stuff.Overall, Wonderful place for the whole family. It comes as a premium cost but great experience. Stay until the evening they will either have a ""dance party"" with light shows in front of the castle or its a small world.  Or they will have fireworks. Either way it's great. We got the park hopper option, went to California adventure around 2:30, and was back at 8:30 for the show. Enjoy!!",5/5,9 months ago on  Google
79,"I've always been conflicted about Disneyland. On one hand there is the magic that really can't be explained well. Disney has cultivated a culture and history that has a life of its own and, honestly, that's a huge draw for a ton of people that come. On the other hand is value.It's impossible to ignore the economics of Disneyland. It's just expensive, plain and simple. You know you're getting kicked in the teeth from the moment you start planning a trip. But once I successfully stuff a gag into the mouth of my inner cynic, I can see what it means to the kids I take there. Is it the best value park to visit? Not by a long shot. Is it the most fun place to visit? I guess that depends on a lot of factors but for me, no it's not. Do my kids love going and do I keep paying out the nose to take them? Yes.Good job Disney, I'll never stop shaking my fist at you but I can't ignore how well you've done your job.",5/5,10 months ago on  Google

I also went on some of my classic favorites like Big thunder mountain, small world, matterhorn, jungle Cruise, and Indiana jones. Got my kiddos some churros and the scarfed it down. They were delicious. The only thing I could say is that the price is here are exorbitantly high. Paid $14 for three bottles of water and $40 for four thin plastic rain ponchos. Due to the recent crazy weather we decided to wait until late afternoon to go into disneyland. We arrived shortly after 5:00 p.m. and left when the park closed. Because it was a bit rainy today the lines for the rides were much shorter than usual. The only ride that had an insanely long slow line was haunted mansion, but it was totally worth it once we got on the ride. My family and I had a great time, and will definitely be back soon, probably on another rainy day.",5/5,4 months ago on  Google

We went on the ride Smugglers run and we had a 5min wait. We went Sunday, but the low wait times were at night time. We didn’t get a chance to ride the Rise of the resistance as it was closed after 9pm so we def. will have to go back again. They also have this yummy nitro cold brew with a tarot cream for coffee lovers at the docking bay 7.

Also check out the gray stuff at Red Rose Tavern. It's amazing and fantastic for Halloween they did the ""grave stuff"".  Oga's Cantina was amazing in my pictures is Oga's Obsession and Five Flower Bread.  We did Oga's with two young kids (5&8) and it was fun though wouldn't recommend longer than 20 to 30 minutes and get reservations so you can sit.  Rontu's impossible gyro thingy was amazing, even for this meat eater.  We use mouse dining (3rd party) and signed up for the text alerts to get notified for reservations.  We got reservations to Blue Bayou, Oga's and Fantasmic on the go based on alerts from the app. Definitely worth it for the text updates, I think it's like $9 a month.  Reservations opened up more as it got closer, especially day before.

93,"The happiest place on Earth! An incredible amusement park, designed with details in mind. Cleanliness and friendliness can be bought for a price, and you can find it at Disneyland- the original standard for amusement parks that all others are judged against.What it’ll cost is a tremendous wad of cash, plus your time and energy. Lines are incredibly long. Lightening Lane passes will increase your ride value, but also cost more. Without the lightening lane passes ($20/person/day in addition to your exorbitant entrance fee) it’s difficult to think that Disney would be worth your time, let alone cost. Some lines are 2-3 hours in length during summer months. Those lines are another $15-18/ride to skip the long line - yes, in addition to your lightening lane passes. Go early and remain late for more reasonable ride lines-but still long. The lines are just so long. Huge lines, massive crowds and limited resources. You can usually pay more for some limited relief from the wait times, but it’s just going to cost you in time no matter what.Most food is very bland and slightly below average quality. The kitsch is also generally average to low quality and fairly high price. Thankfully you may bring food most anything you want into the park so long as it cannot be used as a weapon. Oh, and it’s difficult to locate healthy choices. It’s mostly carb city with low nutritional content and very low taste variety. Desserts are sweet - and that’s about it - just really sweet with low texture development. Gravy is over salted, burgers over cooked with few veggies, shakes melted before you get them, etc…. There are a few exceptions, but only a few. Just plan on $20/person/meal for a very bland and mediocre experience.However, the staff are unmatched in their friendliness and professionalism. No high school minimum wage employees in this park (at least not very many) most are adults and they mostly take their jobs very seriously.Mostly family friendly. The patrons themselves are friendly, which is hard to come by in public these days. Rarely do guests use foul language - which is a huge plus for a public establishment.Park is safe. Leave strollers unattended and no one bothers your stuff - except to move it for scheduled events.Water is a little scarce, with some fountains barely functional. Disney really could improve this feature. But you can still find water in each land and usually fill your water bottles at least 2/3rds full.The park application is sweet, but drains your battery quickly. Plan ahead with a spare battery charger. You can order meals from it, in fact, you are required to in most cases. Line times are fairly accurate and up to date, but they could improve real-time, as they only use approximation based upon line length. It’s a little quirky in its design, but generally very helpful. Without it, your day wouldn’t be as productive.Outside the park you’re in Anaheim. It’s mostly safe to walk to and from the park from most hotels. Homeless are present and some are clearly on drugs. We had to walk past a few tweakers and some passed out homeless sprawled across the sidewalk. It’s difficult to imagine a city with as much tax revenue as is generated by Disneyland still has a homeless problem. There’s less than fifty - just buy them a room or pay them to leave! Or you could provide them with a social worker and resources to get off the street.Disneyland is generally not a thrill ride park, but they are truly unmatched in environment immersion. Even much of the line waiting areas are decorated and cool to look at once you get closer to the ride. Cast members are dressed neatly in costumes that add to the ambiance.Rise of the Resistance is phenomenal. The ride is OK, but the immersive environment is UNMATCHED in detail. This is one of the longest lines, and ride closes early and breaks often (too many moving parts, I guess). The blasters appear to melt steel, the AT-ATs are incredible, the storm trooper troop assembly area is just AMAZING! What a ride.

The prices of everything are insanity, but you're there and you want what they have so, I can't really hold that against them.We brought our toddler down for his second birthday, against my better judgement.  The wife wanted him to have fun so we did it.  Truth be told, at his age, you could have just as much fun going to a local park or mall and letting him run around.  While it seems like a great idea, just know that your child will NOT enjoy it the way you expect till they're closer to 5 years old or so.  Lines don't work for a little child.  There aren't many rides they can even go on and it is a ZOO everywhere.  They can't really even walk around effectively.Disney, big tip: add a ""toddler zone"" with a big play zone for kids to run around and play/mingle.  Throw a bar next to it and whammy, you've made your next billion dollars.People, watch the fireworks from on top of the parking garage.  You can even bring chairs and set them up.

110,"Great rides, delicious foods. The Genie Pass wasn't a help since we arrived to the park in the early afternoon.  Some of the bigger rides had 1.5 hour waits in the standby lanes. The Smugglers Run in StarWars area  still had a 45 minute wait with the Lightening Lane feature. Plan to wait. We didn't have our kids with us so it was easy to wait that long. The ride technology is amazing,  you feel like you are truly on a movie set. The app is really useful to see ahead of time if a ride has shut down. Also to let you know where to find attractions.  California Adventure Land has all the Marvel and Pixar rides & merchandise.  You cant get any if it in Disneyland Park or Downtown Disney. If your an adult, go to Disneyland for Star Wars. California Adventure Land for MCU. The  ""DoleWhip"" is really good. You can find it near the Indiana Jones ride. Try the watermelon.  Getting in and out of the park is really easy & fast. Plan to walk a lot. Bring your own sunscreen. You can buy water in the park and refill it any of the water stations.  If you want to see the main street electrical parade people start lining up at 7:00 for the 8:30 show. The fireworks can be seen no matter where you are in the park. Unless you are a photo enthusiasts,  you don't have to be on main street to enjoy them at the end of your night.",5/5,4 months ago on  Google

114,"Disneyland is an amazing place, there’s no denying the magical atmosphere…However, we were very disappointed in the wait times. Most rides were between one hour and two hours we spent most of our entire day, waiting in line ups, we were from out of country and did not have Wi-Fi so that posed a problem just getting into the park & not being able to load our tickets. It wanted to send a pass code to your email, which we could not access even with the free Wi-Fi so then we could not order food or use any of the genie online services that Disneyland had to offer which was very disappointing. We missed out on a lot because we could not access the app. We paid over $500 for 2 people, and unfortunately only got to go on 4 rides the entire 10 hours we were there. Very disappointed in the price of food items, water was $5US, we ended up purchasing two small bags of chips, and two small bottles of coke and that was $25US. Talk about a price gouge, I know it’s Disneyland, but that’s just way over the top.!!! Still had a good time, like I said, was just disappointed mostly in the app/Wi-Fi issue, and there were a few other people we spoke to that we’re having the same issues, so they need to work on their technical end of this app so that everyone can access it!",3/5,2 months ago on  Google

116,"I havent been to Disneyland or California Adventures since 2009. I brought my 3 kids and myself. Kids are 14, 12, and 6. It still is a magical place but there occupancy of people is overloaded. Scary overloaded in my opinion. If an emergency were to happen it would be interesting to see how people could evacuate safely. The rides are 60-90 minute wait times. So technically you don't have enough time to do one park in a day due to long ride wait times. We had a genie pass as well which helps but you can technically only book rides with that on set times and it equals out to be a genie pass ride about everyother ride. We had an amazing time and went to both parks but disapointed in how many people were there. I know the parks weren't ever this busy in my past visits. For as much as you pay you should be able to at least ride every ride in one park considering we were there for 12 hours. They take reservations now? For what? People are literally packed in like sardines. Little kids have a hard time getting through the crowds, its more of a struggle to get to your next destination. The parade and fireworks are amazing and we did have a blast but I see unsafe conditions ahead if they don't get this under control. In my past visits I always have left Disneyland saying ""Wow, it really is the most magical place on earth"". This time it was disapointing we didn't get to do everything we came to do. I hope they can resolve the issue and have quality control of how many people are in the parks. I also noticed little things like the grounds weren't as clean and kept up as they normally are. More trash in and near rides, it just didn't have the crisp clean feeling it normally does. Again, too many people for employees to keep up with. I would rather make a reservation and have it tell me that day isn't available and wait for a later or sooner date where you can actually walk through the park. Please Disneyland CEO FIX THIS.",3/5,6 months ago on  Google

118,"Oh the memories! I visited Disneyland on 01/17/2022 for the first time in 12 years and yes, it was just as magical as I remembered! Ya’ll now about the rides and attractions so I’m going to focus solely on the noms for this review. I used mobile order where I could, it’s super convenient and we hardly had to wait in line for food. Not all places take mobile orders, you can find which places do and don’t on the Disneyland app. Also I only had one day so I tried my best to stuff myself silly with all the food I could possibly eat.Galaxy’s Edge is a MUST-SEE, even if you’re not a Star Wars fan. Oga’s Cantina is lit AF. The drinks are pricey ($17.00-$19.00) range, but so worth it. And they so SO PRETTY!Looking for sweets? Everyone seems to forget about Pooh Corner. In my opinion, they have some of the best candies in the park. I grabbed a Tigger Tail ($5.95) which was marshmallow dipped in caramel, then dipped in orange chocolate and dripped with milk chocolate. It was super sweet of course, but also very creative, more so than just a cookie or cupcake. Plus it was adorable!!I tried the Lobster Tail ($14.99) ar Harbour Galley to surpress my never-ending desire for lobster nachos i did not get at California Adventure. Honestly, it was meh. For some reason I thought it would be served warm? So it was rather a surprise when I found out it wasn’t. Overall, it was ok but I won’t get it again.Disney corn dogs should be just as iconic as their churros. I grabbed one from the famous Little Red Wagon ($9.95). Red Wagon never disappoints, in my opinion this is THE SPOT for your corn dog fix. I wouldn’t go anywhere else. The batter was sweet and the dog was salty. Damn heavenly.For dinner I ate the highly-praised Ronto-less Garden Wrap (plant based sausage, spicy kimchi slaw, sweet pickled cucumber, plant based go Gochujang spread wrapped in a pita, $12.99). Let me scream it, THIS ITEM IS BANGIN’!!! Hands down one of the best foods you can get. It’s PACKED with flavor, I swear I didn’t even remember this was plant based it tasted so real and good. I washed it all down with some Blue Milk ($7.99) which I don’t get why it gets all the hate and disappointment that it does. It’s actually really good.A trip to Disney without both churros and a Dole whip is just sad, so I made sure I grabbed each before exiting the park. I ordered the Dole Whip Swirl Float ($6.79) from Tropical Hideaway and a churro from the cart near the entrance. I will say I do believe dole whips are slightly overrated but still a must try for anyone who hasn’t had one. The churros are delish as always, I would get one or two every single day.",5/5,11 months ago on  Google
119,"People love theme parks and waiting in lines! Never understood the concept of it. This applies for any theme parks and not just Disney. Doesn’t matter how good or bad an attraction is if you’re waiting 30+ minutes or longer the attraction is not worth it. Why would I wait 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 2 hour for a ride/attraction that may or may not be good. Even if it was good the wait times is not worth it period for 1 minute of excitement. If it wasn’t for our kids we would never go to any theme park that have long wait lines. Never like the concept when I was single with no kids and definitely despise it now with Kids. We had the park hopper and Genie+ and the Genie+ was just a money grab! Want to go on the most popular rides? Your Genie+ LL reservation probably doesn’t work for it. Must purchase for an additional $20 per person to get in the LL lane for the most popular rides. Want to use the LL with your Genie+ purchase, reserve your spot now and come back in an hour. What’s the point in that? After using your reservation you can no longer use your Genie+ LL reservation for another ~1.5 hours unless paying for an additional $20 per rider/ticket per attraction/ride. All in all waste of money. Only good thing is fire works at the end if you manage to stay that long!

Disneyland opened on July 17th, 1955 with 18 rides and attractions. Just one year after Disneyland opened its door, 5 million people had visited the park. As of 2019, more than 700 million people have visited Disneyland.The history of Disneyland is more than six decades-long, and in that time, the park has grown and evolved with the times but has managed to hold on to the magic that beckons people of all ages to visit, and dream of visiting, year after year.Thank you for reading our disneyland review if you love that then prss on like button and want to world tour then fallow me on google maps",5/5,3 months ago on  Google

132,"We visited the park a few days ago. It's better if you pay the lighting lane pass, some of the games you can't use it, but when you can it's great. Most of the employees looked unhappy. The quality in general wasn't looking good. People were not treated well.We were riding the train rollercoaster and sudenlly it got stucked in the middle of the tunnel. They spoke to us through the speakers telling us that someone is coming. After around half an hour they arrived. Lot of kids crying and they never gave us an apology. They just gave us a ticket to use the lighting lane one time in one game, unuseful when you already paid the lighting lane pass. They never gave us at least a small water bottle when we were stuck and looks like they didn't care about the kids crying.When we were leaving, another kid hit his head before entering the car park bus, he started crying on the floor, and the girl organizing the buses didn't care at all. It wasn't a bus there so at the moment she was doing nothing, so come on, walk 2 steps and ask if he is ok. They don't care about anything. The final show it was not that good.

The two drops were at the start of the ride then the rest was sleepy.Several rides broke down throughout the day at California Adventure park.

Well I sadly wouldn’t come back to land until they get their crowds under control. I have been to Disneyland since I’ve been a child and I have never seen it so crowded (mainly with adults) we went on a weekday during school season. I honestly don’t even know what the point of reservations are for if they aren’t managing the crowds. 4 of the rides we got on broke down, and we had to wait a long period of time or get escorted off. If you have a genie pass this can cause issues since you have a window. Sadly we came during Halloween and on a week day so they had a projection show which was so boring, maybe great for toddlers but my 10 and 12 year old asked to leave. I think Disneyland has some work to do since the pandemic, you pay a lot of money for these trips and want to be able to enjoy them without so much pushing and shoving. I understand crowds are normal at a theme park but not to the point where you can barley walk, I have not experienced this at world yet.

It's pretty cool to see the evolution of their love affair mature from young kids to teenagers, something so incredible and unique only Disney can bring about.The park has grown and changed over the years, but it still has the same charm it's always had.It comes with an ever growing price tag, I'm afraid.

Went on a Friday going into Labor Day, and surprisingly the queues generally weren't as long as I had thought - apparently I was lucky!I would say overal ticket price is kinda high, and _because_ it's Disney I feel they could charge a few $ less and be golden, but meh...Popcorn variety is really lacking here compared to Tokyo Disney.And Cast members were shockingly miserable and rude, especially around the Star Wars area. Basic conversational tone met with fairly rude tone by cast members, what's up with that?Anyway, back to positives!Rides I did:Star Wars Rise of the Resistance - now the ride aspect isn't exactly new, but my goodness, this was a transporting experience! Production values are INSANE, highly recommend see it for that alone. Blew me away. Ride broke down but got a fast track ticket for a return later.Star Wars Millennium Falcon - more fun than RotR, and very immersive. Had a blast! May not be for those who don't enjoy being shaken about.Haunted Mansion - the longest queue, went at night. It was enjoyable but not worth the queue length, but as it was the near last thing I did, it gave me much rest. Good production values as usual though.Indiana Jones - I recall this was similar to the Tokyo Disney one. Great production values but queue was long as ride broke down.Space Mountain - this was basically the same as Hong Kong Disney, and I loved it all the same here! Great ride music too! Queue was moderately long.Caught a bit of Fantasmic - super cool if you can catch this, especially when Dragon Maleficent appears!Overall, I had such a good time, but I was fortunate enough to be attending on my own so could take things in, or not, however I wanted to.",4/5,3 months ago on  Google

The lines were as usual depending on the time and the ride, from 15 min to 1 hr and 30 min wait. Now the things I felt did not go to par with the experience expected at Disneyland. The food was not good, and it was expensive. Snacks like pop corn and pretzels were as expected. Another thing I felt was kind of negative was the wait times shown in the Disney app did not represent real times. I went to one ride that was showing a 30 min wait time and I ended up waiting for almost two hours which made me lose the opportunity to see the fireworks. I know the park receives a lot of people on a daily basis but the improvements on better quality of food and more accurate waiting times should be not difficult as they already have the infrastructure. One last thing for better experience, think about getting the fast track upgrade, it does helps as long as you are informed on how to use it. Besides that we enjoyed the visit. Thank you so much and I will see you around.",4/5,2 days ago on  Google
163,"It was a lot of fun and a great experience..... ONCE....I honestly expected more. Granted I am an adult at this point, but I still never got to go to Disney as a kid and I had a lot of high expectations I guess. I can see how a lot of it would be great for kids under the age of 10. I don't understand why people make such a big deal about it though of all ages. It was also way overcrowded after having to book a reservation.. both together makes no sense (it was the week before Christmas so I expected high crowds but wow it was worse than expected). Having to wait in such a long line for some of the rides you got at the end wasn't worth the wait (2 and half hours in line to ride the Cars ride was sooo not worth it, even my daughter said it wasn't worth it)... and the lightning lane thing only kinda works, you basically choose to wait in a line for an hour or walk around for an hour to three hours to wait for you lightning lane reservation time. Again was great to experience once... but I can see how and why people are saying the magic of Disney is gone.Another thing I must mention is the park should really monitor to a certain extent what guests wear at these FAMILY-FRIENDLY parks. Me, my husband,  and our daughter unwilling got to see a women's butt while walking up stairs because of how short her miniskirt was and she was wearing a thong... discusting... and leggings are tights not pants people we can see your private areas and we don't want to (no matter how fat or skinny you are).",3/5,2 weeks ago on  Google

168,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and so my wife and I went to Disneyland for the sole purpose of seeing the newly created Star Wars section. The entirety of that part of Disneyland was created to resemble some desert region that was typical of scenery from some, but not all Star Wars films. It was okay, but underwhelming. I would rather have had a Naboo or futuristic setting that mentally transports you into another world. This reminded me too much of my home in Las Vegas, a huge desert.The two rides were interesting. While there was a great deal of hype regarding the Millennium Falcon ride when they opened, I found it to be just a standard motion machine ride that jostled you around a bit and had you push some buttons too,  but not that great.The other ride was immersive, fun and made you feel like you were not only in the Star Wars world, but it was actually fun. However, and this is a really big however, there is a huge problem with this ride. Apparently, it breaks an average of 4 times daily and must be evacuated when it breaks. This slows the line, which is virtual, down to a crawl. We tried signing into the virtual queue when the clock struck noon, and were told that our estimated wait was 6 hours. We thought wow, what are we going to do for 6 hours. We have been on every ride over the years and weren't interested in anything other than the Star Wars area. My wife was content to shop for the day in Disneyland and at Downtown Disney.As our day progressed, the line didn't. We went from a 6 hour wait, to seven, then eight and eventually a nine hour wait for a single ride. I enjoyed my day and the ride, but the wait was ridiculous. I can't say that I would ever return to wait that long to ride that ride or any ride ever again. This review will be quickly disappeared by Disney, they hate bad publicity and don't want people to know the reality of the major shortcomings involved in this new area. By the way, I heard that you can now purchase a fast pass for a single ride on these rides for $20. (Don't quote me on the price, I'm not exactly sure) I would have gladly paid that or even a bit more to not have to wait quite so long for the ride.",3/5,4 months ago on  Google

171,"We went for one day and tickets cost $164 each. Parking was $30, in which we also purchased ahead of time. Definitely plan ahead. We purchased a week and a half before our trip and although it wasn't the day we originally planned, everything worked out. My teens first Disneyland visit and they had fun. The only downside was waiting in line for the rides. Definitely get the Genie Service,  it's only $20 per ticket, which I somehow mistaken the price. We arrived by 9am and waited for parking for about 15 minutes. Then walked towards the tram and did the security clearance [bag check, metal detector]. The tram was quick and they had multiple going at a time, back and forth, so the wait was less than 10 minutes. We were on the Disneyland Park side, so we walked and enjoyed the day there [was there for about 9 hours]. We didn't stay for the parade or fireworks. By the end of the day, the sun was too much. After being there all day, we realized it's better to go just before the sun sets, less sun exposure, shorter lines. Merchandise and food was definitely pricey.

177,"This last week was my 4th family vacation to Disneyland/California Adventure, and by far, the worse. The last trip was 5 years ago. A LOT has changed since our last visit..... for the worse. The Genie+ extra charge per person, per day, is unbelievable. I pay thousands for tickets, then pay hundreds more for Genie+?! For my family, to get everyone Genie+ each day would have been an extra $800, for our 4-day hoppers. $30 parking, $20 locker, extra $$ for very popular rides IN ADDITION to the $25 Genie+, exorbitant food prices. Di$ney.Disneyland isn't the only place this has happened, but, with all the sensitivity to every demographic that Disney focuses on, I didn't think we would have to deal with this at the ""happiest place on earth""... we have 3 biological children and 3 adopted  children. My children are every color of the rainbow. The constant questions of ""are you together?"" or ""are these your children?"" (in front of our children), is inappropriate. Ticket checkers, ride operators, and characters all messed this up. Some sensitivity training might be in order.The requirement of scheduling which park to start and which to hop, is dumb. What's REALLY dumb is that there are only a few gates left you hop at 1:00. All others don't allow entry until 1:05! Why?! We wasted a lot of time in line, trying to get to a ride right at 1:00, only to be turned away!Experienced several rude employees this trip, which had never happened in the past.Several rides have unequal lines. EX. the line on the left at Pirates is shorter. A couple of others I can't recall, too.A LOT of broken down/closed rides. That has never been an issue in the past either. Nothing is more frustrating than being in line for 30 minutes, then hearing the announcement that the ride has been shut down. Or, being on a ride when it breaks down. Happened 10+ times to us. For the price of tickets, there should be redundancy on top of redundancy to ensure max uptime.Pick-up/drop-off area is horribly mismanaged/unmanaged.App works well for ride times and mobile food orders.

And then you go get your food and it’s with an angry face and manner. Like if I could serve my food myself I would. And the lines are well it’s inevitable but  the amount you are paying you expect at least 5 rides but each one is one hour or two. The Halloween parade is a joke.

When we finally managed to do it, the person who was Minnie on 27th of Oct, at 7 PM at Disneyland Park, near the entrance, (Disney doesn’t want to share the name so it’s the best description I have to identify the person) was extremely rude with my daughter. Probably because my mom that knew how much my daughter waited to get that photo and doesn’t speak English, tried to get into the 6 o’clock queue after they closed it. I admit that this is our fault, I took her out of the queue and explained the process but Minnie shouldn’t take revenge on a toddler later on. She completely ignored my daughter and what made me write this review is that while she was signing the autograph book my daughter tried to hug her and Minnie pushed her away showing that she’s done...

All the way to the fact that to have a chance to ride some rides either you wait in line for multiple hours, or you pay the extra money to be treated better then the others. This idea has change the entire dynamic of Disney. It has monetized happiness for those who have the money to be VIP. Here is the real crux, we spent it, we wanted our granddaughters to be able to be on some of those rides and we spent it. I don't believe Walt would have expected people to pay the prices they pay to ride 4 to 5 rides a day in a 14 hour day.

I know they will eventually, enough people have had enough. Until then we will be enjoying other parks.",2/5,2 months ago on  Google

Then there is Ginnie for virtual waiting that does not work or give you odd times for the ride! Personnel generally are rude and unfriendly! There was a guy who was taking people’s strollers from where they were parked to another side without letting people know where they are moving their belongings. When I told them this is not fair, they made a scene out of this and told me this is a private property and they can decide whatever they want to do! Come on! You are charging people expensive tickets and you do whatever you want because this is a private property?!!

224,"Let me start with the positive; the park is well maintained and the staff (by day) is friendly! Also the restaurants are very suitable for people with allergies which is great!But for us the experience was not so good overall, because we came from the Netherlands and had only one day in the park I also bought the genius+ (for the whole family). We followed the app suggestions but due to outages/failures and the first available slots we could use the lightning lane for only 1 time in 1 attraction. For the rest we had to stand in line for more then 1 house most of the time. Also in my opinion there are no real thrill rides (not one), most of them are more simulator rides, the park in Paris has a lot more to offer if you seek that. And we could not do all attractions because of the outages/failures. In the evening we could not see the parade from a good spot because most of the places are reserved?! And the staff is directing all people to the main street where you cannot see everything.This was by far the most expensive day of our holiday in the US and at the same time the most disappointing. I did send an email to Disney to inform them about this, you would at least expect an offer to reimburse the cost for the genius+ which was completely unusable for us but after more then 4 weeks waiting I received a response with apologies.",2/5,3 months ago on  Google

232,"How far Disneyland has fallen over time!! I grew up on Disneyland CA, every Summer for 18+ years. This year we took the whole family for the first time since the nightmare we experienced at Disneyland Paris 7 years ago (at that location almost nothing worked, and the people were rude).Disneyland CA wasn't much better: Rides were broken down all over the park, many were repaired only to break down again as we arrived back in line. This happened multiple times, even on the same rides! We had the Genie pass and app, but it was a joke. To get in line on the app and wait, usually for hours, to go wait in a line of other pass holders, was just ridiculous. To only be able to schedule one ride at a time (and only after you had ridden your planned ride) was just plain insulting. We entered the park as it opened, and closed it down, and were able to ride 8 attractions over 13 hours. Add that to our cost of over a thousand dollars for tickets, Genie, parking, $5 cokes/water, lunch etc... and we all agreed as a family - we're done with Disneyland.My nephews, who live nearby, warned us to ""go without the expectation of riding attractions, but with the idea of experiencing the Disney feeling."" Our teenage sons weren't interested in old town saloons, seeing characters, eating or buying toys...they wanted to ride. We were sadly disappointed. If you have very young kids, they may still find Disneyland magical, but if you grew up watching the transition from ""E-tickets"" to whole-park access fees, you may find it maddening and sad.",2/5,4 months ago on  Google

236,"Disneyland is magical. A big part of the magic is provided by the many kind and smiling service staff and cast members. We visited during a heat wave and despite the melting heat, employees continued to smile, wave, and clean in the heat. Thank you, it is you who makes this place magical.To fully enjoy Disneyland  it's more for 10+. Even our 6+ found it too big, hot, loud, crowded and requested to return to the hotel everyday by noon even after we used Genie+ lightning lanes in September. They also did not last long enough to watch the shows at night even with a nap. Our kids lasted full days at other theme parks. This park is not for autistic kids, they will have a terrible time from over stimulation and very loud rides. People with nut allergies also be aware that Disneyland serves and sells food with nuts.Another watch out for days where they have special events and the park closes early. Translation you are paying for a full price day but you are not welcome to stay for the special event, the web site verbiage is particularly vague about it. They also allow special event guests to come early so the line ups swell by 4pm. It is the same price as an 8am to 12 am ticket but you only get to enjoy 8am to 4pm. Guest services would not allow us to move to the other park without paying another$60 per person even though we paid $100 per person already expecting to play at night when it's cooler.I was also sad to learn the staff make below average salaries. No cast member brought this up, I searched it after wondering what the compensation is for people who have to work in multi layer outfits in the baking sun. Also the crowds aren't limited, so high margins, high volume, high profits. I really hope Disneyland will share the magic with the people who make the magic and continuously clean up after the crowds.I feel torn about Disneyland. I love the magical world they created, I love that they are the largest employer in the area providing jobs, traffic, tourism for all the businesses that support it. I love that there is no experience like Disney, no one beats them at theming and cutting edge new interactive rides and continuous entertainment. But we need Disney to step up in paying their staff above average salaries. And I recommend being less greedy. We are a young family and would've been happy to return every year but between the poor pay practice and the policy to charge full rates for half-day of fun with fine print that does not explicitly say we are not welcome to the special event, and not providing any concession makes me not want to return and not want to spend money here again.",3/5,2 months ago on  Google

Once you have a reservation, book dining and experiences when you are within 60 days of the dates. If you're looking to maximize time in the park, pay for the genie plus for your group and book rides in the app. While waiting between rides, look for characters you want to take pics with, trade pins with cast members, shop, use the photo pass, or get on rides that can't be reserved in app. If you have young kids, get to fantasyland early or go towards the late afternoon when it isn't as hectic because people are taking nap breaks.

The wait times for rides were around 2hrs if not using the pathetic lightning pass that limits you to one booked/reserved ride at a time. While waiting for our booked lightening pass ride, we tried to go on other rides, but the wait times were so long we averaged maybe 4 major rides a day. Then when it was time to book another ride, many rides were booked out and unavailable. On top of this, several major rides broke down repeatedly while we were in line waiting. When I was a teen (1990s) I could do Disneyland in a day. It was less crowded and ride wait times of 45 mins were considered long back then. The experience has changed for the worse.

Then to my unpleasant surprise, we then had to pay for INDIVIDUAL fast passes for the more newer and more popular rides that the Genie+ alone wouldn't cover; Rise of the Resistance was an additional $20 per person for ONE fast pass entry, Radiator Springs Racers was $15 additional per person for ONE ride (on a ride that is 10 years old by the way), Spider-man Adventure $12 additional per person for one ride. It's a joke. Then my next frustration was the fact that the Guardians of the Galaxy ride was out of commission for the better part of the whole day on our final day of our trip along with many others as the rides would bounce around all day from being open to ""temporarily closed"" to open again. It felt impossible to plan our day as things kept going out of commission. It even got to the point where we got a complimentary fast pass to any attraction because the one we booked for closed down. Additionally, there was not a single parade over the 3 days we spent there, even though they were proudly selling electric parade balloons. Every time we would see a character at their post taking pictures we would get in line just for the cast member to tell us ""oh, just so you know that character may change by the time you get up there"". Well my kid wants to see Mickey not one of his friends...Disney probably feels like they can justify these prices and policies because people will pay and keep coming back. Well I take no pleasure in saying we wont be back for a very long time. One because we wont be able to afford it as often as we would like and two its a matter of principle. Disney is taking advantage of their customers left and right, asking them to pay top dollar for an enjoyable efficient experience when that should be the standard. The capacity is way too high and the prices are even higher. Time to find a different ""happiest place on earth"" because Disney has lost its X factor.",3/5,4 months ago on  Google
279,The rides broke down more than once. The quality of the food is to the point I asked myself what could I tolerate. The employees look worn down and overworked. Bathrooms where dirty most of the time. It’s like being at the DMV that has rides that maybe work.Of course the kids liked the trip. I loved looking at my kids reactions. I feel like the nostalgia of the past makes me want to like it. This is a different Disney that is riding on it’s old coat tails that are running tattered and defeated.The price for everything in the park and around it is a war of attrition on the pocket book. The products inside are as hollow as the new movies coming out.Two stars because of the price for this park. Lack of reliability for the rides.Lack of a good choice of food.,2/5,3 months ago on  Google

Disneyland had lines moving at a reasonable pace for the volume of people there. CA Adventure was a lot slower. There were some rides we waited for over an hour and still didn't get on. We eventually gave up and decided the rides weren't worth the wait. Too many people, too many crowds, with hardly any masks in sight.

291,"Went here for the first time the day before Thanksgiving, and it was super crowded by midday, but I was still able to have a good experience overall.Highly recommend downloading the Disneyland app to plan your day and getting the Genie pass to minimize wait times. The Genie pass is worth the cost to save time and improve your overall experience. I was able to go on almost all of the rides I wanted to go on in 1 day because of these things. The Disneyland app is also helpful for making reservations for restaurants if you plan to eat in the park. It was fun to try a restaurant for my first visit to Disneyland, but honestly the food wasn’t anything to write home about so it felt overpriced. Paying for the atmosphere of the restaurant was somewhat worth it but not for the food. I ate at the Blue Bayou and it was a cool experience to be dining near the water of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. I think I would leave the park to eat better food for less money in the future though. Also, I started checking for reservations a week in advance and was not able to make a reservation until the night before. I assume someone cancelled last minute in this case so I would recommend trying to make restaurant reservations as soon as possible and checking the app regularly for openings.Also recommend going on the popular rides that you really want to go on first thing in the morning to avoid wait times and decrease the chances of the ride breaking down. It seemed like rides were more likely to break down as the day went on. I waited over an hour in the afternoon for the Star Wars ride only for it to break down and be closed for the rest of the day, but they gave us a free lightning lane pass to compensate, so it wasn’t super infuriating. It’s annoying for rides to break down for the day though given how much the tickets cost. I would not recommend going if the potential for rides to break down would ruin your day.Overall, I think it’s worth visiting if you’ve never been, but I’m not sure I would come back again soon given the crowds and expense. I hope this review helps you have a good experience :) it is a magical place for sure.",4/5,a month ago on  Google

If the park is available for a park hopper then it should be available for a single park day! The crowds were insane so, reservations help with crowds.. a joke. Plus, paid extra for Genie only to find out it’s an additional 15.00 for Cars and an additional 25.00 for star wars fast lane. Having to have things preselected and checked in after every ride made trying to enjoy the ride your on not at all pleasant because, your worried about booking the next ride. Even the Cast was frustrated. For someone who loves Disney this was the most price gauging and unmagical experience every! Very disappointed.

294,"Super disappointing experience. Paid for the lightening lane but only 3 rides have that available to use. On top of that they control at what time you can actually use the lightening pass. For example: Winnie the Pooh available 3-4pm. Now you can only book 1 ride at a time! Meaning that the u finish Winnie the Pooh at 3:10 and now can book another ride that’s not Available for lightening lane until 7:45-8:45pm. It’s a joke. Minimum wait times for stand by lane is 45min-over an hour. The park was ridiculously packed. Shoulder to shoulder. No room to breathe. Every restaurant/shop has lines waiting out the door. Honestly horrible experience. Will never do Disneyland again unless they begin to control the crowds to the wait times are manageable. It could be a great experience like it was 10 years ago, but they ruin it with having crazy crazy crowds.

297,"We went to Disney during the holidays. It’s quite a spectacle to see during Christmas. Really amazing what they do to decorate the place. The decor is incredible.The park is so much fun. There are few places in the world where you can do so much together as a family. The rides are excellent and satisfying for all ages. The World of Color and fireworks displays are second to none. It’s really magical.Our dates were December 20, 21, 25 and 26. The parks were packed beyond what’s comfortable. It’s way, way too crowded. At times we couldn’t walk, and could only go in the direction of the flow of traffic. It felt unsafe to be crammed within that many other people. Disney staff do a great job directing flow but it’s just way beyond what should be allowed. There are easily 10,000 too many people in both parks at any given time; all of our days were capacity (no reservations left). We would never go back again during the holidays. You wait for rides. Wait for food. Wait for the bathrooms. You wait for every - single - thing. Even to find a seat to take a break you need to wait.Several of the ride wait times were 80-100 minutes and as high as 185 minutes. The Genie+ system is a must have, but it’s definitely not as efficient compared to the old Fast Pass system. Many times the next available time slot is 5-8 hours in the future, so it’s hard to plan effectively. I’d hate to do the park without the Genie+ though, or all you’d do all day is wait in line for rides.We last went in 2019 and even since then the parks feel like more of a money grab. Paying to do Lightning Lanes individually to avoid a 3 hour wait time when you’ve already spent thousands of dollars to get into the park feels dirty and greedy. Even still, it’s worth the cost and Disney knows it.One major annoyance to me was redemption of “multi-experience” Genie+ passes that are awarded to you when a ride is broken down during your time window. On our last day we had a Genie+ booked for the Incredicoaster,  but the ride was closed for maintenance during our time window so we were credited with one of these multi use passes. We were extremely disappointed how many rides were excluded from this list. We couldn’t use this pass on any of the big rides, so we ended up not using it at all. The incredicoaster is a big ride. Why would this one-off pass not be good on equally sized rides? Space Mountain, Matterhorn Bobsleds, Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy were all excluded. That’s ridiculous!Lastly, be prepared to walk a pile. We averaged 26,000 steps each day and easily could have gone 10k more if we were up for it. It’s a lot of waking. Use the monorail and trains for big distances to save your steps.We won’t be returning to Disneyland any time soon. It’s just way too crowded, which is so unfortunate. It’s an amazing place without the crowds.",4/5,a week ago on  Google

It shun through their attitude. I felt bad for them too. People were literally gaining up in gift shop stores to cool themselves down and kids. I made a reservation for Savi's but was cancelled without notice so I had to reschedule and wait almost 2 hrs. The Genie service while useful needs upgrading or maybe offer a higher tier to book more rides at once, not try and charge $20 separately  to book certain rides. Not as user friendly as they think it is (my husband is not as tech savvy as most, was annoyed with the app) Rides smelled musty and looked grimey. My allergies were acting up in Pirates like crazy.

We are a family with a child with Complex Medical needs, we got the DAS ( It was amazing) the Cast Members were incredible but the crowds were horrible.  If you like crowds you have to deal with after a playoff game in the NFL or the crowds that leave after fireworks then you should be fine.  That is how our entire week at DL was.  The early morning was less but not by much.  You would wait 20-40 minutes to just buy a churro or grab a water.  We used Mobil ordering 97% of the time but our child loves popcorn so finding one that was not backed up to the entrance was difficult.  Not to mention there is almost no seating outside of restaurants in the whole park.  We also did two days at California Adventure and that was MUCH better.  We could maneuver our child's wheelchair with ease, there was seating everywhere and the park was just more user friendly.  It hurts my heart to know the place I loved as a child has become so crowded and not friendly to children with medical needs.

On our last trip, on the final day of our stay, we stayed til closing. We caught the fireworks show with our children, and then wandered around just enjoying the experience. THIS time, the staff ushered people along so relentlessly my 8 year old broke down in tears from being herded like sheep and we just gave up on trying to let them see the fireworks show. One staff member immediately tried to move us along even though we were out of the way for a moment trying to decide which way we were going to go. The plan was to catch the fireworks show *maybe* and then do a few more rides that had closed for the show. Instead we gave up in exasperation and just left altogether. REALLY felt like since we had already paid for tickets the main focus was pushing merchandise and getting people to move along.

338,"I’m not even really sure where to start. My entire family and I feel robbed, saddened, and disappointed. Disney isn’t as fun or as magical as it used to be, even just 5 years ago when I came last time.For one, the employees were incredibly mean. It made my son cry, and I ended up crying too out of frustration and disappointment. I had no idea how the Genie+ stuff worked, and they literally YELLED at us when we were just confused. They market the Genie passes as a sure fire way too get into the rides faster than everyone else, but most of the rides aren’t even compatible with the Genie pass. On top of that, you have to make “reservations” on the rides that do Genie passes, and most of the times aren’t available to book until late at night, 10 p.m. ish  (if it even lets you book, or if the ride isn’t broken down, that is). On rides that I did book for my family, the app kept LOGGING ME OUT when it was time to scan. I showed this to the employee, and he said he “can see that the app isn’t working, but can’t help us or let us in.” (You’ll need a newer phone and space to download the disney app to even do any of this by the way, they rely on the customer to have both reservations and a charged cell phone at all times basically). On another ride i tried to reserve. the Indiana Jones one, the ride broke down when it was finally time. After this, my family and I just decided to go home. Overall, the employees were just being super mean and not explaining or helping or suggesting things in any way.Secondly, it was just way too crowded. I couldn’t believe how many people they let in in one day. I couldn’t take a full step at any point in the park, it was just too crowded. The parents with strollers ramming into people didn’t help either.Third, the overpriced food was genuinely terrible. I hadn’t eaten all day and still couldn’t finish my burger.If you happen to be reading this review and have gotten this far, don’t take your family to disney. I took my family to Universal Studios the next day to make up for the absolute mess that happened at Disney. Universal Studios was so much better. You could actually walk around, and the fast passes were actually what they were marketed to be. And the food was actually decent! (not too great but better than that sh*t disney gave us). Disney has turned into a money hungry sh*t hole and I wish i could take it all back for my family. I feel embarrassed that I suggested Disney, and i feel terrible for all the money that we all spent there. It left a bad taste in our mouths for the rest of our trip to California.

It's somewhat more crowded and cramped, compared to Disney World in Orlando.We got there at 9:45 on Sunday and had to wait about 40 minutes in line to get through security. Then it was a short (less than 5 minute) wait to buy tickets and to enter the park.Lines for food were long, but mobile ordering helped us save some time, and we were able to wait in comfort at a table instead of standing in line with two young kids. I have a dairy allergy and the mobile ordering has allergy friendly options if you scroll to the bottom of the menu when ordering.

I recently went and now I'll have to really contemplate the next time I want to be back.  Three of the rides I was in line for broke down while I was waiting. This caused the wait for each ride to be 1-2 hours longer. Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars Rise of the Resistance, and Storybook Land Canal Boats all broke down while I was in line. There was also rampant line cutting on the longer rides. It felt like a local twenty dollar theme park with the cutting.  Also, Toon Town was closed while they add another attraction and there was no night parade.  It's just no longer fun and no longer worth it.  So as they keep raising prices and charge for things that used to be free I'll have to pass.

Also allowing season pass holders to go on any day, over crowds the park.

We rode 2 rides and left after 5 hours. One of those rides broke down while we were waiting. Cast members really don’t seem like they want to be there (I don’t blame them) and the magic is definitely gone. We weren’t able to make any reservations for a sit down restaurant, and pick up orders were an hour minimum booked in advance. No real snack options either. There were only 2 characters out on the characters map. No parade. No fireworks. People were crammed like sardines no matter where you were in the park. I’ve been to Disney World a few times pre-Covid and always loved it, even as an adult. Disneyland is a watered down version of DW, and now I am even hesitant to go back there after this experience. I’m a huge fan of Eeyore and only found 1 small plush of him in a candy shop. We asked a cast member and they stated they don’t sell him there. Neither did Downtown Disney. How are you Disney and NOT sell Eeyore?! Too much focus on the newer characters. They have strayed away from the majority of the original Pooh characters, which was a major disappointment.

This was my first ever experience and I looked and researched the internet for questions on how to get there best experience in 1 day. The best option is to get the Fast Pass or Max Pass through the Disney App. It saves so much time standing in long lines and it's accessible right on your phone. Planning your day is easier and you have lots of time to try other rides before going to the best ones that take the longest. Plan to bring a backup charger as there are no charging stations anywhere. If you are someone who loves to take pics this can drain your phone fast. Also bring plenty of snacks and water bottles so you can eat on the go. The food isn't that great and truly over priced. You're kids will still be hungry.Plan your day before you get there so you are familiar with the layout. Then you can have an idea of everywhere you will want to be.If you are going to stay all day and into the evening, plan a warm coat in the winter months to watch the water show and fireworks.

We have gone over 15 times and after this poor experience, it will probably be our last. We bought park hopper tickets for Sunday the 16th of October. We showed up at 7:45am for the rope drop. We were pushed by a frantic crowed but managed to escape without harm. We went to haunted mansion first and the ride was closed at open because it was down. So we bought the lightning pass for Star Wars for $25 a person extra and went over to Star Wars. And once we got there, the ride was down as well!  We were only there for one day so we had a tight schedule to make all the ride, or at least the main rides. We were able to ride some other rides and then came back to Star Wars and still down. Then to Indian jones, down. Then we went to space mountain, waited in an hour line just for the ride to break again. So now it’s about 2pm and haven’t rode that many rides. So we go over to California adventure because it closes at 6pm for Halloween. We pay an extra $15 a ticket for Cars on top of our normal genie pass to find out it’s down when we get there. So we went to incredible coaster and came back and Cars was up! But now we used two genie passes so we had to wait till 6pm to use our next. The lines for Soaring and Guardians were over two hours! So no chance of riding those because it closes at 6pm. So we went to grizzly and that was down! So we booked our next lightning pass for Indian jones. It was at 6:45. We get kicked out of California adventure and get to Indian and what do you know, down. So we are frustrated. The Disney employee was super nice and gave us a free front of the line, but it only works on certain rides. So we go to auto nation or whatever it is since the line says 15 mins. We wait 45 mins, to get right to the front and it closes! Literally waited in line 3-4 hours during the day just to hear it was down and you have to leave. We walked over 17 miles! I understand things happen and rides break, but literally 10 plus rides were down! So we went to guest relations and talked to Aires, who was the supervisor. We explained our frustration and how it impacted our trip and day. We spent over $1k, bought the park hopper, genie plus, and extra passes for the “special” rides. It was our anniversary trip and it put a damper on our excitement. She never once said I’m sorry, or I understand, all she said was ok, ok, ok. Horrible customer experience! She only offered an “experience pass” for next trip. So a front of a line pass for next trip haha. We declined, because at that point, tired, battled, and worn we were not coming back.

357,"Underwhelming rides, poor lightning lane system, and very few options for people that have dairy allergies/do not eat meat1. Underwhelming rides: Most of the rides felt like I was at a carnival not Disneyland. We waited in unbelievable long lines for rides that were just ok. The only ride in the entire park that was worth it was Star Wars Rise of the resistance and you had to pay $25/per person extra for lighting lane. From what I remember Space Mountain was worth it but the line was over 2 hours long all day on a Monday. Not worth thr time and money that you have to spend to experience 2 rides.2. Lightning Lane: This was our first time st Disneyland so knowing how long lines are in amusement parks, we opted to get Disney's version of a fast pass. In our experience, when you purchase a fast pass, you walk up to a ride and there's a separate line and your wait time is around 15 to 20 minutes. While Lightning Lane sounds like this, trust me it is not. When you purchase Lightning Lane it only allows you to ""prebook"" 1 ride at a time. So for example let's say you wanted to do splash mountain and star tours which are very close together. When you book Lightning Lane it reserves a specific time frame later in the day. So at 3pm it might say that you can go ride star tours between 530 and 630 PM. Annoying but ok. While we wait 2 hours let's see if we can book Space mountain.  Oh wait! You can't because you can only pre-book one experience at a time. So then you have the option to wait in a 2 hour long line and then hope you get out in time to make your pre-book window. It is a terrible system3. My wife is pescatarian and therefore does not eat any meat other than fish/seafood. There was a max of 2 restaurants in the entire park that served something that she could eat, and they were booked for the entire day. We found options for salads and asked if they could remove the chicken and cheese and we were told that they are pre-made so there can be no substitutions. The only thing she ate the entire day was a veggie skewer we found in Adventureland.All in all I would not recommend this place.

375,"DISNEYLAND RESORT VIP TOURS REVIEW:This was a disappointing experience, especially considering the price. For $700/hour, I would have expected there would be a guest services line available past 4 PM.Even though it was listed on our VIP Tour Itinerary, when we arrived at the restaurant we were told we had no reservation and would be added to the waitlist of 2+ hours. As this was dinnertime (and after 4 PM), there was no one available to help us: our tour guide was no longer responding to texts/calls, the VIP phone line was closed, and the chat system in the app told us the same that the VIP services was closed. We had10 people and no place for dinner on our final night. We ended up going back to our hotel and ordering DoorDash.Earlier in the day our lunch reservation (that I had made for 1:00 PM 61 days in advance on the VIP phone line) was rescheduled for 2 PM, but then we weren't even seated until 2:45 PM. At $700/hour, waiting around for our ""reservation"" cost us $525. These meal issues were the final straw and has made some of us say we won't be returning and the rest of us seriously question whether we'd ever come back to Disneyland again.The only benefits for the tour that we saw were essentially shorter lines (lightning lanes, alternate entrances for non-lightning lane rides, short waits for character meet and greets) and reserved seating for shows. But I'd like to add that there should be an asterisk for people thinking of booking a VIP tour for California Adventure. Our guides told us they have far less privileges in California Adventure; for example they couldn't get us a meet and greet for Anna and Elsa or any other character in California Adventure. One of the evening shows was booked out so we couldn't even use the reserved seating privilege then.The term VIP makes one think of extra special features; one of our guides didn't even have any trivia to share about the park. There were no special surprises. When you drop $5-$7K plus tip on a tour, Bob and Disney could at least throw in some complimentary waters, ponchos for the water rides, a stuffed animal/special souvenir pin/ears, a behind-the-scenes tour, or 10% off dining. Guests should receive Genie+ for the days they get the tours; having to buy additional Genie+ for before/after the tours is ridiculous. And yes, many people are celebrating something when they come to Disneyland, but for VIP tours there should be something more than a button with permanent marker scrawled on it.The price of the VIP tours should also allow their guests to do park hopping, especially since California Adventure is such a disappointment. Even then we didn't always get to go to the attractions we wanted. Toontown is closed, It's a Small World is closed, Monster's Inc is closed, Redwood Creek is closed. The monorail would go down, Indiana Jones was broken, Winnie the Pooh was broken, and most disappointingly--as it was a huge reason we booked VIP--Rise of the Resistance was broken from early afternoon until close. On our second day of the VIP tour our guide gave us a pass to ride Rise but we couldn't use them anyways since we only had a ticket for Adventure that day.Essentially, this shouldn't be called a VIP tour. There is nothing remotely VIP-level about it. In reality it's a a ""pay exorbitant prices to go into shorter lines, sometimes"" tour.Our cast members told us they are shocked at the high cost of the tour, as well as that the demand for VIP tours has doubled post-Covid. They also told us they don't get any park or trivia training to become a VIP tour guide and that over 60% of the people working are new in the last year. I doubt anything will change because demand is so high. Overall, we are leaving this trip disappointed, frustrated, and feeling totally ripped off and scammed.2 stars for friendly workers throughout the entire park, some good (but outrageously expensive) meals and shopping, and never having to wait for a bathroom stall.",2/5,2 months ago on  Google
376,"I will just copy my California adventure post because they are basically one and the same. I’d give it 5 but it is so over priced and the wait times are sooo ridiculous. And the fast pass is hit and miss. I’ll quote a fellow reviewer because she hit it on the head. As long as you keep perspective, it really can be the ""happiest place on Earth!"" The only downside is the cost. I am so sad that Disney has become exclusive and not inclusive economically speaking. The best discount that you can find is typically around $10 off. Today, the one day single park peak days ticket costs $149 for people 10 years and older!!! That is so sad for families who may need a little Disney magic, but are not well off. The food is typically priced for amusement park food but Disney has better quality. You can bring it backpacks and your own snacks of on a budget. I would also recommend purchasing the $15 max pass. It includes professional pictures for download and it really does save time and gets you in some of the bigger rides during the day. “Tara walker",4/5,2 years ago on  Google

If you don't go a lot, then I'd recommend getting the lighting line option so you may experience all the rides. The reason I'm taking a star away is because of the way managers treat you when you make a mistake. We were used to comicon reactions and wanted to see how Boba fett would react if we slightly tapped his heel. Short answer: Don't touch the actors unless they confront you first. This is a rule we understand, and we are sorry for. But the manager that came to correct us just kept gaslighting the situation as he went on to explain how we would get kicked out if we did it again and how unethical it was. After we apologized, he took it as a backhand apology and kept going on about how he could call security. Keep in mind that we already felt bad for the situation, and his aggressive response just made the situation worse.

It's like they'd rather be somewhere else. Don't get me wrong. Some are outstanding but ya kinda gotta search for those these days.Prices are tough no matter what they are as we are navigating economic squalls. So that's fun....As far as the Parks Segment of the Company - you need to keep telling the story! That's what has captured hearts for generations.Another huge problem is the stock price. The valuation has gone way down. That's what happens when shareholders ""leave."" Now, you must ask the question - why did they leave?Perhaps a large group of shareholders aren't impressed with the many twists and turns (and maybe flops) at the box office. That's just one thing they're upset about. Can you guess any others. To tack on a few more:-You can't implement a reservation system at a place people call ""home."" Think about that for a second.-Disneyland Park is very sacred, that's true.  But, DLR, as a whole, needs something cool, new and fast. People also want a thrill. Don't get me wrong, experiences are amazing and the Parks Segment is very good at that. However, I'm afraid that's where all the budget/focus went as far as pivoting/progressing to a new chapter in the Parks.  AKA ya need the ""fast rides"" too. I mean when Racers opened. Just amazing!

Clearly they are not happy in their jobs. The food didn't cater for all, everything was either fried or had cheese on it or sugar and cream init and when asked to change this we just get a huff and a look from the unhappy server. The first ride we TRIED to get on broke down after 45mins of waiting in line and this was the new Spiderman ride. After eventually getting on this ride (2hrs later), the ride was not worth the wait. All it does to move around a circle while spinning you around and its over in about 2mins.When the characters walk around some of the surrounding staff were not very nice telling kids to move back and basically pushing the kids away from their heros. Dr strange show was disappointing and like the spiderman ride unimaginative. Most characters just waved from the Avengers base and did not interact with anyone on the ground. All in all for a place that claims to be the happiest place on earth, I think only the CEOs are happy with how much money they are taking from people who just want to have a good day and meet some of their favourite characters. Disney are getting too big for their boots these days and it's all cost before care.

This trip was for my 5 year old cousin as a early birthday gift to try to bring his spirits up and show him the so-called “Disney Magic”, after the sudden, devastating and tragic loss of his father. This trip did the complete opposite, as at times he was in tears.I will first mention that 99% of the cast members looked completely miserable &  un-happy and it was very uncomfortable. Not only were they un-happy, they were very demeaning, hostile and rude. Not only the ride attendants, but cast members when we had questions on where to find things at.. There was only one female cast member on the outside of Pirates that was so kind and helped us locate on the map where we could buy a phone charger.Gabriel (the special birthday boy), had actually lost his balance while getting off of one of the Star Wars rides, I did not see, I only heard screaming and crying as I was trying to help assist with the 2 year old. When I turned around the cast member that was standing less than 10 feet away from him, was just standing there starring at him, not only him but the two other gentleman that were down there as well.. They did not come up and ask him how he was, or try to cheer him up like we thought they would.. Instead, we had to tell Gabriel that Disney was going to kick us out if we kept crying, because that’s how stand-offish the feeling and vibe was.As we were leaving Disneyland, we decided instead of parking at the theme park, we would just Uber from the hotel to Disneyland and back to defeat traffic.. A man in a blacked-out suburban was parked inside the rideshare area on Harbor Blvd and had stuff his head out and in a odd voice asked if we would want a ride.. This was the icing on the cake, after a horrible day.. to feel unsafe as we were exiting the park.. There was so security or anything. There were several confrontations and angry people out in that area getting into fights. This is not something someone who has two young children 5 and under should have to experience, no-one should feel un-safe for that matter.Not only that, but people were wearing gang affiliation as well has different type of weapon pins on their clothing (AR 15s, pistols, etc).. very uncomforting having to explain to the kids about this",1/5,2 months ago on  Google

Anyways me and my family were in line and we had our two kids with us (ages 9 and 6) and they needed to go to the restroom, so my mother decided to stay in line for us while me and my husband took our kids to the restroom. We took a little longer than we thought. My mother calls me and tells me to hurry because our turn was coming up soon. I guess we didn’t make it on time and my mother told that young lady that she was waiting for us to get there (my mom also asked someone before we got in line if it was ok for her to get in line or save our spot if we needed to step out to go to the restroom or anything like that and they said it was ok. She spoke to someone in Spanish about it.) I guess this young lady wasn’t having it and told my mother that she couldn’t do that and that only two people can get on the ride and my mom said ok that her grand kids are coming and her daughter (me) to get on the ride. I guess she didn’t like that answer and told my mom “no, now your grandkids can’t get on the ride either” my mom said that that wasn’t fair that we’ve been waiting in line for an hour and half and that in other rides, if the kids needed to go use the restroom they would let us do that, to which the young lady said that they shouldn’t be allowing that to happen and that she didn’t believe my mom and us were waiting in line for that long.

Overall the park looks exactly like the Magic Kingdom but is a smaller version with a hint of Hollywood Studios. The food is amazing and Galaxy’s Edge is a great addition to the park. This is a very manageable park without extremely long wait times. The longest I waited for a ride was an hour. My only gripes are that the park is very small so it gets crowded fast. There isn’t a lot to do and we were able to finish the all the rides we wanted to do in less than three days. I’m not sure if I would consider ever going back to the park because I know Disney World has a lot more to offer. I also feel like Disney World is getting more updates where Disneyland is a historic site.,5/5,3 years ago on  Google

They have water fountains to refill your water bottles unless you want to pay $5 for new one. Make sure to down load the App and buy the fast pass it is worth it. It will save lots of time and energy you don't have to walk as much.

418,"The saddest place on earthI am sure at some point, Disneyland was the happiest place on earth, but as of this review, that is no longer the case.Everyone there except me was stressed and or sad. All the families were at odds and at their breaking points. The advertised bliss and happiness were not a reality for them. I mean, who can blame them?Disneyland can no longer handle crowds. Especially for holiday visitors. I have been here at this park for over ten years. I know what I am talking about when it comes to crowd control. The park was at a similar capacity years ago but without the struggle and intensity of choke points and large walls of people. This past success was due to proper management of the flow of guests. During this visit, all of the above seemed to go out of the window. It was indeed an apocalyptic Disney disaster. There were moments when we were stuck on specific pathways. Such as the castle crossing.The new fast pass system, genie plus, is a rip-off. Fast passes are now available for fifteen dollars instead of being free as they always have been for years. Despite this cheap move, the app is making fast passes paperless, which I can appreciate. Once the app is installed and paid for, it works wonderfully. Unless you are doing the top attractions like Cars or Rise of the Resistance, it will remain the price you pay for Genie Plus. The Cars during this visit were 25 dollars per guest, and the Rise of the Resistance was 50 dollars per guest. I could understand paying for top attractions but for all the fast passes? Common Disney, this is not the state fair.Every single aspect of Disney is overpriced as of late.Their main goals seemed to have shifted dramatically from family-friendly entertainment to family marketing.This review is more about the park than the hotel. Go to my Disney hotel review to see the horrors that awaited me. All I will say is that for $800 rooms at night, the service received was that of a Motel 6.If you are going to come here, buying park tickets is no longer enough for the magical experience.Every purchase is touchless, meaning cash is useless in the park.Disneyland is one thing to do in your life. With the current state of affairs going on right now is not the time to visit. Disney needs to fix the problems that currently plague the park.",1/5,a week ago on  Google

427,So fun but super crowed and food is expensive. I suggest you buy the max fast pass. You get to go into the park an hour before they open to the regular crowd and you'll be able to ride about four rides in that hour.

Really want to point out that Disneyland is very doable alone as well.

They were not dissatisfied. Disneyland delivered at 💯. The only thing the girls complaint about was all the walking they had to do.  So make sure to plan on bringing comfortable shoes. The other big recommendation is to invest in the max pass. That just helped us out tremendously. We were able to get on double the rides. We like to bring in home made burritos , snacks and lunch. We just end up having dinner from Disney. The clam chowder bowl is worth it. Also please make sure to bring  hand sanitizers. Although we took ours we also made sure to take plenty of bathroom breaks just to wash our hands.

The crowds can be a bit much here, but they are all having a good time! The entire time I was here, I felt as if I was in a fantasy land..The rides were a blast. Space mountain was a first time, and trust me, it was a life changer. On jungle cruise, our tour guide was extremely funny; and on the Indiana Jones ride, I truly felt like I was part of one of my favorite movie trilogies. The rides seem as if they are gingerly taken care of each day by amazing staff they have.The food was flawless. We dined at the Blue Bayou (We did have to make a reservation), and found no problems! The gumbo was delicious. :)There were thousands of chairs scattered around the park, so even if you just want to relax in the happiest place on Earth, you will have the convenience at your fingertips!Unfortunately, the crowds can be one's undoing.

Don't just go in a big circle, and don't be afraid to go from one side to the other. The park isn't that big when you think about it.

My sister surprised me with tickets when I was visiting her. We got to experience Disneyland together for the first time!- Fast pass is the way to go.

I skipped finding Nemo because I'm claustrophobic but had a great chat with the employee Jamie. Gave me great info on rides I could get on and enjoy.  Very happy with our recent visit. Stayed all day from when they opened till closing time. Was a little tiered the next day but so worth it. Just the look on my daughter's face was priceless. It was her first time going and first time for us going as a family. All the characters are super friendly and in character. They don't ignore the kids that want signatures for their little books or just a picture. The restrooms were clean and they have various restrooms around the park. The food here is also inexpensive we ate at Galactic burger. Also if you want to see the fireworks. You will get a great view by The finding Nemo ride and galactic burger. The new star wars area is super cool especially at night. Some lines are long wait but if you have a fast pass should be pretty quick.

In this new society of being inclusive, with disney (and rightly so) enabling more cultural equality in their movies and film, Why is is still ok to separate the rich and the poor in the parks, with things like genie pass, if you pay more, you get better treatment, if you pay more, you get on the rides faster. Where is the equality between the people that cannot and can afford a genie pass ? So you are pounding equality into everyone's head but at the parks the rich go first, the poor go second, hmm.. it sounds like money talks and the equality of disney / disneyland is not so equal after all. After seeing this diversity and separation at the park, It make me sick to go back, Walt wanted the park to be enjoyed by all equally, not so equal anymore, pretend to be inclusive to feed their bottom line... so sad",2/5,a month ago on  Google

482,"Happiest place on earth indeed. Everything inside is quite expensive, so I’d recommend bringing in food and drinks from outside (which is allowed, just make sure you let the folks know before you walk in, no need to hide it). Parking is quite easy with lots of people giving directions, but would recommend coming early to get a good spot and have less wait time on the shuttle into the park.Look online for blogs about how to use the FastPass system effectively - it’s really a game changer. Also, make sure you don’t lose your water bottle. Even if you go ask for it later, they generally destroy any water bottles that are lost for safety reasons, so you won’t see it again.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

With so many classics such as The Haunted Mansion and The Matterhorn combined with an entourage of new attractions such as Star Wars land, you can truly get lost exploring all there is to see here. We brought our two year old with us, and even though she was too small for some of the rides, she was tall enough for at least half of the attractions. She absolutely loved every second of being here. If you play the fast pass system well enough, you can avoid most of the longest waits. Definitely download the app to stay up to date with wait times around the park.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google
485,Disneyland is not what it use to be. We spent over $200 for the fast pass to find out you have to download the app to use the fast pass. You can only reserve one slot at a time then after you use it there's a cool down period before you can reserve the next one. And there are some rides that you still have to pay an additional $20 for the fast pass. 100% NOT WORTH getting. Please save yourself the extra dollar and spend it on something else.Then I ended up getting a blister and was bleeding so I asked if they had a bandaid and they told me it's $1.50 for some bandaids and they weren't even good bandaids they were the cheap plastic bandaids that falls off after 5 min. For the happiest place on earth they couldn't spare a 5 cent bandaid.Overall for what it was the rides and attractions were still pretty fun to ride. The scenery is still eye captivating.

We arrived around 10 am and did not have to wait more than 25 minutes for any ride. We took the max pass and it saved us a ton of time on most lines. Some rides did not operate at times but that happens. It took time to get food and other concessions due to slow and long lines. Do take max pass, it's totally worth it. You'll do a lot more rides during the day instead of waiting in lines and have the park photographers take a ton of pictures to download thru the max pass benefit.",4/5,4 years ago on  Google

Tarzans tree house, millennium falcon, Indiana Jones, pirates of the Caribbean, haunted mansion, buzz light year, hyperspace mountain, and many more. Each ride got better and better. I think the new Star Wars park is the best. You can build your own droid and make your own lightsaber. The food in the Star Wars park was unbelievable. We also got the photo pass which is the best thing ever. Every photographer in the park will upload your pictures to your phone. My favorite place to eat was Pizza Planet.

The cast members are helpful and seem genuinely happy to be there. The park does a great job with most things they do and it is a joy to be there. However it can get pretty crowded and lines can get really long. It is not a place to go if are looking for fun with no wait. Also some of the ride lines have no cover from the sun or rain so that can be hard to deal with for some people. But when the sun sets and the lights twinkle on, it's just magical. Also the food they have there is great and worth the wait and price (for the most part). One place that is great to go for couples is the Blue Bayou in the New Orleans section of the park. It is beautiful and has great food. It is actually inside The Pirates of the Caribbean ride, so is dark and cool, making it a great escape from the heat and crowds. It is expensive but great food.

Diane and Cap had us stand before everyone waiting to get in as everyone wished her a Happy Birthday. It made her Birthday amazing from the start. Everywhere we went they made her day special, she was treated like a princes at every attraction, by every character and at every meal. She even got to walk Pluto. That was this last December 2018, two months ago, and because of that great experience, we are already planning our return.

I wish it was easier to find adult food. There had to be a churro cart every 20 feet or so although delicious I was starving for something real to put in my stomach. Other than that, buying a 1 day pass is a waste of time especially if you have kids. Get two days because we were there for 1 day and only got on two rides. That’s because all the lines were ridiculous. Even if you pay extra for the fast pass all you are doing is making an appointment to come back..... too much walking, I actually saw pregnant women there, bless you ladies. This adventure was a workout take my advice and wear the comfy shoes and lose clothes. Lastly where the hell was mickey?

I prefer the ones outside of Disneyland so I can get what I need when park hopping between California Adventure. Be prepared for a wait. The lines are always long.

And you can purchase food/beverages and pick up at any restaurant or store with the time frame you choose. They also have a Max pass you can purchase which allows you to keep all the pictures taken on the rides and by the professional photographers at the parks as well as get fast passes without having to stop by the physical stations *one pass must be purchased per person. When getting fast passes make them count! Use them for the rides with the longest wait times.Things you should bring: sunscreen, snacks, a jacket and hand sanitizer.

Find a spot right in front of Sleeping Beauty's Castle. But off to the right side a bit so you can see Matterhorn. They have a display show on Matterhorn plus Tinkerbell comes down from it. Then head over to Fantasmic for the 10:30 pm. show.I know it's a little late for Fantasmic show, but this way you can see both fireworks and Fantasmic. Get a FastPass for Fantasmic first thing in the morning. Within an hour of the Park opening.Your Fantasmic FastPass does not count against a ride FastPass. Right after you get the Fantasmic FastPass go get a popular ride FastPass.I recommend getting MaxPass on the Disneyland app so that way you don't have to walk to each ride to get a FastPass.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google
544,"My whole life, I have always wanted to go to Disneyland, and finally had the chance to go. I went on a Wednesday with my boyfriend, and since it was a weekday we thought it wouldn't be so crowded, but we were wrong.Despite the huge crowds, wait times were not bad; it really helped that we downloaded the app, which helped us plan out which rides to go on (the app has live wait times.) We rode almost every ride, excepted for the Peter Pan ride and the Haunted Mansion. Along with checking out every section, we also were able to watch the parade and living show. I appreciate that the park is open until 10PM, since this gave us ample time to experience everything.The only disappointment I had with this visit, was that the iconic castle was under construction, so I didn't get to check it out. However, there was so much to see and experience, I left happy and ready to come again and check out the other park.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

The walk when you first get there is such a pain though...and after a 10 hour day we were struggling to get back to our car. I wish they had a shuttle like they do in Downtown Disney. But once we got in the park it was so much fun! I definitely recommend getting the Genie app! We were able to get on so many rides because of the lightning lane perk! It's not so good at planning out the day but once you see all the things that you can do, you can make your own plan! My favorite ride would have to be the smugglers run at Galaxys Edge. The food here is not cheap so make sure that you come prepared! But I'm sure there are budget friendly options. An example of this would be when I bought a ronto taco and one of the speciality drinks for 20$ in the star wars district...and then my boyfriend and I went to the Rancho del Zocalo restaurant and spent 40$ on bigger servings and appetizers worth of food. Overall, it was a better deal. I really wish I could have gone through the lightsaber experience but the cost of one at (200+) dollars is more than I paid for two tickets...so I had to pass. I really had a great time and I wish I could've stayed there forever...but please lower your prices on some things inside the park or work on deals and we'd be able to visit more often! NOTE: nobody was wearing their masks or keeping distance outside of attractions and in buildings. Even in attractions, the lines were very squished but we went on a Thursday so the wait wasn't very long. (I'd recommend going on a weekday).

They captured the scenes and structures of the movie so perfectly, I could cry. They also had the food and wine festival going on which is always a plus. When we were done with that park, we decided to go over to the castle and to space mountain because of course we wanted to see the magical fireworks. Little did we know that BOTH the castle AND space mountain were under repair. The castle was covered by a big box with a backdrop picture of the castle. We were so disappointed.

We usually go Thanksgiving week and this was our first trip in the Spring. Spring is Disney is SO lovely! They have the most beautiful, immaculately cared for, trees and bushes blooming gorgeous fragrant flowers all around the park.The Disney parks are well engineered with an extreme attention to detail and understanding of how to provide a full-experience, not just a theme park. The cast (staff) are top notch in terms of their talent, knowledge and customer service skills. The park is incredibly clean. They have it all down to a science and it's such a well run machine. Even if you don't have children (we don't) it can still be a lot of fun.Disney really is the happiest place on earth if you or your loved ones have a food allergy. It is probably the safest place to vacation and truly enables you to relax because you have one less thing to worry about while traveling.Allergy/Dietary restriction tips:- Download the Disneyland app! It's truly a must for meal planning if you have a dietary restriction!! For all dining in both of the parks you can view the menus and see which items are gluten/free, nut, fish and soy free. You can even order and pay for your food through the app, saving you time from waiting in yet more lines. All dining staff we've encountered were knowledge about Celiac disease and allergy protocol. In three visits my husband has never been glutened in any of the dining establishments in the park OR in Downtown Disney.- This brings me to Downtown Disney. We've eaten at most of the restaurants in DTD and found very similar level of service and knowledge about food allergies. Some menus even have have the GF markings, like Tortilla Joes, but even those that don't, like the bowling alley, are very knowledgeable and a accommodating. The main benefit of eating in DTD is the more extensive menus. Most, but not all, of the dining options in the park have small menus and are not ideal with large group. DTD restaurants are more spacious and have regular restaurant  sized menus.- There is at least one restaurant (Cocina Cucamonga Mexican Grill in the Pier area) in California Adventure park where we were told none of the items even contain gluten. This makes it an ideal stop if you have Celiacs Disease or a gluten allergy.General tips:- If you have a Chase Disney Debt card many of the dining establishments and shops in the parks and in Downtown Disney offer discounts (often 10% off). Look up the current offers before your trip or ask at the restaurant/store in-person.- The app is really necessity at this point to make the most of your visit. It shows park maps, dining options/menus, approximate wait times, which rides are closed, allows you to get Lighting pass, Genie Plus, etc.- If you know a Magic Key holder, have them make a reservation and take you to Club 33, an exclusive fine dining establishment tucked away in the French Quarter.

602,"Well, it's not the Disneyland of my youth, meaning much of the creativity and uniqueness is gone. It's commercialized. It is synergized, meaning, Disney leverages this park to cross sell it's other products. Gone are the one-of-a-kind shop and other places that offered unique items. Now, it is pretty much the same product park wide. That said, it is a fun place. Something else that is way different are the crowds. Wow, this place is so crowded now. Lines during some times can be a very long wait. Food is mediocre. Sometimes I think you are better heading to the Hotel / Downtown Disney and eating. Either way, dining in park or outside, it will be expensive. But, it's Disneyland so it is a great, fun experience. In my opinion, the classic rides still make the park, like Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Matterhorn, Big Thunder, etc. Everyone should visit Disneyland at least once in their lifetime to see where it all started.",4/5,6 years ago on  Google

Entertainment options opening back up means there are even more options of things to do during your visit!I don’t recommend genie+ service personally, especially if you have multiple days in the parks.

My group and I remarked at how happy everyone seems to be.The details at Disneyland are what got my attention. There are theme parks all over this country (USA) but no other place puts a higher attention to detail than Disneyland. Every door and window, every chair and table, they all fit perfectly. Nothing is squeezed in or thought up later. All pieces fit precisely and run smoothly.

615,"Had an AMAZING time at Galaxy’s Edge!  As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I hugely appreciate the level of detail Disney, Disney Imagineering and Lucasfilm packed into this epic addition to Disneyland! It exceeded my expectations, and my expectations were not low.Got up super early on a Thursday to beat the crowd (spoiler: we didn’t) in order to increase our chances of getting on the new Rise of the Resistance ride. Fortunately, at the strike of 9 am, we scored Boarding Group 24!Both RotR and Smuggler’s Run are very fun rides. The queues themselves for either ride are also very enjoyable. I do wish they switched one queuing area on RotR that follows the First Order Star Destroyer hanger bay, it would be much more thrilling to be forced to line up by First Order officers when surrounded by a legion of Stormtroopers rather than in a hallway outside of detention cells.Going one day ultimately I think isn’t enough time to fully appreciate the breadth of enjoyment packed into one park within Disneyland. I think I could easily spend 2 full days in Galaxy’s Edge to see literally every little detail, such as using the Datapad on the app, looking for hidden Easter eggs, riding RotR more than once to look for more details, and riding Smuggler’s Run in order to play all 3 roles (have only played as Pilot so far, but that was extremely fun!).The only thing I yearned a little bit more for was Star Wars aliens! This outpost, being an in-universe Star Wars planet, should be teeming with exotic aliens that we’ve seen either on screen, other media or never before! Hopefully they steadily increase the number of park staff dressed an fun costumes!

618,"Happy please on earth Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It was the first Disney theme park. Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.[2] Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot.Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits since it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had approximately 18.6 million visits, making it the second most visited amusement park in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom, the very park it inspired.[3] According to a March 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are supported by the Disneyland Resort, including about 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent contractors or their employees).[4] Disney announced ""Project Stardust"" in 2019, which included major structural renovations to the park to account for higher attendance numbers.[5]",5/5,2 years ago on  Google
619,"This was our first time here! We had a great time making memories, and seeing as much as we could! We have a 7 and 3 hear old, so they wernt crazy about rides. Which saved us tons of time because the lines are long! Although we had the MaxPass, it is only available on a handful of rides, not all of them. Prices of food and treats wernt too bad either, which surprised me! That was nice! But a friend told me you can actually bring in your own food which is nice if on a travel budget.We did a lot of walking and so thankful to have our stroller, but there are some available at the park, not sure how much to rent them tho.I would reccomend purchasing the photopass! Their photos come out clean and crisp! And if you have the app it goes straight to your disney app! And it's perfect when trying to get pic with the characters! Hint on  finding the characters, we found them right when you enter the park! They kept popping out from the side which made it easy for us! They do have a time limit on the photos with characters, but you can go to Toon town and find them in their character houses!Also check the app for show times, and parades! They are worth it, plus get seating at least half hour before it starts because they block areas off, and then it's hard to see. And stay for the fireworks if you can! They are wonderful!Hope this helps any first timer!Plan plan plan if you have time! Download their app, save money, buy the photo package, and have lots of fun!!!

I was blown away at how much my children enjoyed the park, rides, meeting the characters and watching all the shows. The kids kept hugging and kissing my husband and I to thank us for bringing them to Disneyland as it is the happiest place on earth.I found the age to a great age for the kids as my son was able to go on some of the more exciting rides as he just passed 40 inches (102cm). They especially loved the Big Thunder Roller Coaster and Splash Mountain.What I liked about Disneyland was that everything was included. There were no extra costs for kids to play, go on rides or do activities.Meeting the characters was fun, initially, my kids were reserved and hesitant however every character we met took the time to talk to the kids, give a unique compliment and ask questions. This helped the kids to feel comfortable and take amazing photos. Also, if you take an autograph book each of the characters will happily sign the book for you. The kids loved this and were speaking about how many autographs they got, and I was thrilled to have the memorable photos. Each of the characters does an amazing job at staying in character and their sidekicks are friendly and happy.The Disneyland app was wonderful, it literally is everything that is happening in the park. We could see how long wait time for rides are (then target the rides with shorter wait times). I believed this helped us to fit more rides in during our visit. Also, it gives show and character time and locations as well as dining options. The Wi-Fi is disappointing at times while waiting in queue as we had no reception in certain areas.The ‘Fantasmic’ night time Spectacular event was phenomenal, we were all blown away by the lights and storyline. We also loved the show Mickey and the Magical Map, this was such a great show for the kids and adults with a wonderful lesson for all of us remember.I feel privileged and am grateful to have had the opportunity to have taken the children to Disneyland.

Helpful staff. Everyone should definitely do research on all the services the park has to offer before attending because it can be overwhelming if you are just winging it...once we downloaded the Disney App, life became a lot easier and we really enjoyed ourselves. The Disney characters could have been more available. The weather was great and the sun was out...despite the rain. Anything above 70 degrees and sunny might be too much to handle for anyone who is not used to southern climates. 70 degrees in the south is not the same as 70 degrees in the north. The lines are long but move pretty quickly. It's very crowded so I recommend a restraint or stroller for really young children. It's expensive but the surrounding areas of Anaheim...ie Walmart and other local stores, have no shortage of Disney memorabilia. The rain ponchos that are for sale at Disney,  while very convenient,  smelled very toxic and gave my husband a headache. Perhaps they can purchase the more expensive and less toxic materials. There were times when rides were down and some attractions weren't even being operated. We didn't get to see the castle because of renovations. Overall, there was a lot to do and see.

656,"I've grown up coming to this park with my family at least once a year. As I've gotten older, we decided to venture out and try Disney World as well. Disneyland is 10x better than Disney World. For starters, Disneyland is a lot cheaper. Everything at Disney World is really spread apart and you have to take 30 minute tram rides just to get to another park. At Disneyland, you're able to just take a quick walk to get to California Adventures. Once inside the park, you'll realize just how great of an environment this is. Adults and kids of any ages will enjoy this place. It's worth every penny. The scenery, the rides, the food, everything about it is so much fun. The workers are also very nice and take time to help you. If you're ever trying to decide which Disney park in America you should go to, let my answer be your deciding factor. Also, even if we're not comparing this place to other amusement parks, it would still be ranked high. It's just a fun, enjoyable place to be. I highly recommend Disneyland to everyone. It's definitely worth every penny!",5/5,5 years ago on  Google

There are few rides only included in this pass, and actually you could get the come back time for all of these rides for free from the kiosk next to the attraction. The only good thing about this pass that you could get the digital photos that Disneyland photographers will take. There is no specific times for the characters appearances. My daughter is a great Winnie the Pooh’s fans, and we went two consecutive days to Disneyland hoping to see Winnie, but he was already done ( or not coming). Very crowded, there is no place to sit and for sure there is no sparkling fans around ( like universal studios) or shaded areas. I am very disappointed with this visit. I had a great expectation for Disneyland, I had been to Disney world and for sure I had better memories. Disneyland unfortunately is just waiting in line and walking.Yet, the parade is a fun to watch and the fireworks as well which we were seated behind the castle so we were able the see the fireworks, but we missed the lights/ movies display on the castle.

That said, my Disneyland experience always tends to be peppered with a mixture of frustration and stress. This time was similar, but there are always bright, shining moments that only Disney staff can illuminate. I am truly thankful for them. One is the Main Street photographer who took our first group photo. At 9am, few people are at their most photogenic, I am sure. And I wish I had gotten his name from his name tag. He was a delight! A lovely older African American man whose brevity and joy was infectious! The next was also another young female photographer on Main Street who was set up next to the photography shop on a day when some filming for the Christmas Special was going on. She was a part time photographer and a Disneyphile who loved her job so much that i also loved it for her. Rarely do you find places with employees spilling over with this kind of joy. My last and most memorable employee i happened upon at the end of an especially long and exhausting day. His name was Curtis and he manned the Cali-Popcorn stand in Downtown Disney. I was resting on a seat nearby and he was popping kettle corn and dancing and singing along with the carols playing in the background. I struck up a chat about the popularity of popcorn at Disneyland to find it was low, but he was undaunted. His energy was infectious and a true delight. Even when a batch turned into caramel corn by 5 seconds too long, he didn't let it get to him. I nicknamed him Popcorn Curtis because he was bouncy and energetic. I would suggest visiting his stand and purchasing a bag and saying hello! Our little time chatting was the highlight of a trying day. Also, the new Star Wars is Ah-MAZING and the attention to detail is exquisite. Just try not to overload it simply because it is new. Also, at CA Adventure, it looks like a marvel area is in the works. Stay tuned!",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

731,"The best theme park ever. Due to time constraint i only visited the classic disneyland theme park. But it was an awesome experience. The rides are equally awesome. All rides will give you a different experience. If you are disney fan, visiting this place will definitely give you goosebumps. The parade of disneyland is a must attending show. It should not be missed. This parade with its soundtrack is just a very different experience and if you are visiting disney land you should not miss this parade.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google
732,"It's a designed theme park built to indulge a love of Disney films and shows; if you can accept/embrace that with either minimal cynism or outright enthusiasm you'll have a fun time.The park has done a lot of updates to improve over all experience. Healthy fruit and veggie snack stands are all over the place, water is available at every snack stand and resturant (this didn't used to be the case). They've also worked hard to ensure no matter where you are in line that there is shade either from a structure, tree, or awning; no more dying from sun exposure while you wait for rides.The pass system is a must, if you can afford it, we found it cut our waiting time by well over 1/2 sometimes even as much as 4/5.If you want to shop for trinkets, toys, clothing, art, home accessories, etc my advice is to save your money for Downtown Disney. That area had much more variety and better quality Disney themed items than the park.I took a star off because while some snacks have improved, given the prices they charge I think Disney could do a much better job on the quality of the meal offerings in most of the park resturants and cafes. They also haven't really gotten a handle on wrangling strollers/wheelchair parking; there never seems to be enough room or in some places there is no designated room at all. We didn't have a stroller, but because it's generally choas for stroller parking the spillover often congested walk ways or blocked them alltogether.My final reason I took a star off is because for all of their improvements, the park is STILL not mostly or completely accessible to those in wheelchairs. The train only has 2 stops that are wheelchair friendly, which sort of defeats the purpose. Some walk areas or sections of the park are too tight for a wheelchair to comfortably manuver in (including getting to and using toilets). With all the effort Disney is making to update the park, I had hoped accessibility would have been a priority but it very much hasn't been it seems.",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

If you want to get your photo taken in front of the castle (I mean who doesn't) have a plan before you get there because it gets crowded.

We were late as our American airlines flight was cancelled hence started the day in Park from 1:00 pm almost as we reached LAX at 11:30 am . Below the details of it -Reached and then rented a locker in Disneyland park for our carry on luggage . Then we started with one by one .1. Big thunder Fastpass collection (2 pm - 3 pm)2. Had homemade chicken sandwich (I made it and it was without mayonnaise and healthy red leaf lettuce) in lunch3. Tried to enter at 1:50 pm in Big thunder but couldn't as it was before time and machine was not showing green after scanning my Disneyland ticket4. Able to collect next pass after 2 pm hence went for Indiana Jones Fastpass and got time from 4:50 pm.5. Collected free First visit Pin from Guest Service. Also got Riverside sticker. It was a good souvenir from Disneyland park .6. Came back and completed Big thunder.7. Completed few without Fastpass Ride , like - Pinocchio's Daring Journey , Casey Junior circus train , Sleeping beauty castle walk through .8. Then Mickey's Sansational parade at 3:30 pm .9. Went for Finding Nemo submarine voyage .10. Then in the Jungle cruise11. Meanwhile collected Splash Mountain Fastpass from 7:40 pm12. Then took the Haunted Mansion Fastpass and accordingly completed them13. There was a Tarzan Walk thru which was merely good going14. Had snacks and then Visited Toontown and met Mickey15. Had Popcorn and watched the Fireworks at 9:30 pm16. Plaza Inn specialty chicken in dinner17. Completed journey by Little world ⛵ boat tourNote : Collect Fastpass to cover most of the rides and use the Disney app wisely . Check for suitable wait time and Fastpass time . Remember you can collect as many as Fastpass as you want but there is a twist . Like I had one first pass from 6:20 pm to 7:20 pm and I was able to get another Fastpass after 6:20 pm only not before than that . So if you collect a Fastpass at 3 pm for a 9 pm ride then you will only be able to collect next Fastpass after 9 pm , meaning you have to then stand in the stand-by line and wait time may be 30 minutes on an average .Let's plan and excute the same , may be you can follow mine .Please try to start from 8 am , less crowd and more fun 😁😎Check out my photos , I will post some more ...",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

Of course we went on all the classic Disneyland rides: Peter Pan's Flight, Tea Cups, Big Thunder Mt Railroad, It's A Small World (and yes we broke down in this one. Lol!), Pirates of the Caribbean. etc... however, our goal for this trip was to hit up all the new attractions (well... new to us).Make sure you download the Disneyland app so you can utilize the map, fast passes, Rise of the Resistance Lottery, and ride wait times.Pixar Pier is fun, a definite upgrade from what it was, and of course you can't miss Toy Story Midway Mania but Radiator Springs Racers in Cars Land is an absolute must. Such a simple idea but executed so well, this was my favorite ride in the park.Guardian's of the Galaxy Mission: Breakout! was exciting... and kind of scary. Lol! Having been on the Tower of Terror ride a few times, I was excited to check out the changes, and even my sister, who is afraid of heights, wanted to go on it. Rider beware, this is a fun ride but is definitely way more intense than Tower of Terror. You really don't have time to catch your breath. The ride is different depending on what song is chosen for your experience. Not sure if intensity is the same across the board, but we were shaken up pretty good. Yes it's fun, yes you should go on it at least once, no I did not go on it a 2nd time this trip but yes I would go on it again in a few years. Oh, and yes my sister was traumatized. Good times! Lol!The highlight of our trip was Galaxy's Edge. I love, love, loved this park. Having been raised on Star Wars (I am in my late 30's) this was definitely a dream come true. My goal was to go on all the rides, get a fun souvenir, and get my picture taken with Chewbacca. I was successful at all of these. The rides were fun. Make sure you pay attention on Rise of the Resistance. We watched one poor man get yelled at by multiple Imperial Generals because he was playing on his phone and not doing what they were telling him to do. It was hilarious for the rest of us. We built a customized R2 unit at the Droid Depot and it's absolutely adorable. (For those of you who can't fathom spending $100+ on a toy robot, head over to Tomorrow Land and build a little R2/C3PO model for $11/each if you buy 2. They also have toy light sabers you can build for the little ones.) Definitely get the Galma Garlic Puffed Cheese chips for a yummy snack (1 bag fed 4 adults for half a day). The atmosphere is what makes this park amazing. The sets are so detailed you actually feel like you are in another world. There are characters around every corner. We saw R2-D2, Chewy, Rey, Storm Troopers, and Kylo Ren, and there were a couple of characters running around that I didn't recognize. If you get the opportunity, definitely visit Galaxy's Edge.Food Note: Hit up Jolly Holiday Bakery Cafe, near Main Street, and get the raspberry macarons (this was our favorite thing we ate the entire trip), and get a Macaroni and Cheese Cone at the Cozy Cone Cafe in Cars Land. Also, the Caesar Salad at the Boardwalk Pizza and Pasta in Paradise Garden Park (DCA) is a great option when you are tired of eating all the yummy, but heavy, junk food throughout the park.",5/5,2 years ago on  Google

Great re birth. Done really well.  And Star Tours is better than the new ride in Galaxies Edge sorry to say.  Although Galaxies Edge is super cool.

I had tickets for myself and two siblings from Montana, and they immediately understood our situation and helped by issuing a full refund. I was honestly shocked by Universal's compassion and expected more protest.To the contrary, I have been bluntly refused refund by ""The Happiest Place on Earth,"" an establishment which predicates itself on being ""Family-Friendly"" and ""Family Oriented."" Similarly to my Universal Studios tickets, I purchased 3 Disney park tickets and parking, for close to $800. After hours on the phone, online, transfers and emails, I was repeatedly refused refund. True, the tickets were offered to be retained for later use, but that is of NO USE to me now when I need to book last-minute, expensive plane tickets across the country.I'm very disappointed in Disney, but not fully surprised by this let down, especially considering other ""Family situations"" associated with Disney in the last several years, such as the brawl that took place in mid-day there, where Disney employees did NOTHING to help (just like in my situation) as a family tore each other apart.At risk of being dramatic, I equate their apathy and indifference to my loss and plight as no less than despicable to the level of their own worst movie villains. I expected Disney to act more akin to their heroes and heroins that we all so enjoy and admire, and PAY them for, rather than their antagonists...Especially given their immense financial stature of the recent decade, I guess I just expected a little more benevolence from them, rather than miserly reticence to understand the human condition.Being new to LA and never having been to Disney before, I strongly advise all newcomers to, as well as veterans of Disney to approach them carefully and with the scrutinizing eye of qualified legal counsel. All is not as ""magical"" as it may seem.",1/5,4 months ago on  Google
787,"Disneyland is no where near the happiest place on earth. Ticket pricing is insanely expensive. They took away the option for fast lane. You now have to purchase which is 130 per person. The food is horrible and they reduced the portion size. The wait times are always excessive. To many dang people. Everyone would think since they raised the tickets, Disney would at least increase the quality of everything else. Instead they make everything more expensive.

Then straight after this get a fast pass for one of the main ones. In our case was space mountain. Then head off to do another ride while you await your fast pass time. We found this for us 3 rides in early before the queues arrive.Definitely take snacks food is expensive. And if you are in anyway health conscious you would want your own food.Get a timetable for shows and try and plan your day around the shows they are great and you dont want to miss them.Overall would recommend to anyone just bring some snacks",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

792,"This review is long and more so feedback for Disney Parks. I did not know who to tell my thoughts to while visiting the parks. This review is regarding the recent expansion of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and my eighth trip to a Disney Park.My group of 5 went to Disneyland for Galaxy's Edge and Halloween Time.Firstly, the food at Disneyland is not as good as Disney world. Less options for healthy food than at Disney world. Lamplight Lounge was great! Flavorful, great wait staff, theming off the charts.   Carnation cafe always a staple for breakfast. Earl of sandwich is a win. But Ballast Point in Downtown Disney and Naples Pizza in Downtown Disney were just short of awful.Star Wars Galaxy's Edge was disappointing. The land was overhyped and the Smugglers Run ride was lacking in its connection with guests. Too much going on for a choose your own adventure ride. The controls weren't sensitive enough so when you went left or right you had to really punch it. Very disconnected from the guest experience ""flying"" the Falcon and what we saw on the screen. By the end of this short ride, we were deflated and one person said ""that was it?"" Many guests coming off the ride also expressed our sentiments. Engineer is a pathetic role on the ship and leaves somebody in the party out. Pilot is the best role and even that isn't saying much.I understand what the Imaginears were going for but the ride fell flat for our party of 5. The wait times were not even the complaint from our group! It just felt the land was rushed to be completed. It's an immersive land and even a non Star Wars fan can enjoy their time. The land is beautifully crafted with fine details. The food in Star Wars Land was great, actually. We had 5 meals from Docking Bay 7 and all were the best we had on our 6 day park trip. The characters roaming around, the merch, the high quality detailing... It's a fantastic walk through but not as Wow, dare I say, as the Wizarding World of Harry Potter... Sigh. I love Disney more than anything... That was tough to say. :(The cast members in Galaxy's Edge and DCA and Disneyland's Magic Kingdom are always top notch and create such a magical time. I am a loyal Disney Parks patron counting 8+ trips in 16 years. I have seen some great ingenuity and creativity from the company. I have seen the opening disaster of DCA (the first time) to the opening of cars land and re theming of DCA. I know Disney Parks can do better than a lack luster simulation ride. Star Tours is amazing! And Smugglers Run didn't even compare to that. Our time in the parks were spent in the magic Kingdom 3 days and DCA for  2 days. Of the 3 days we only popped into star wars. I spent more time exploring Cars Land when that was a new land, so based on this comparison, Star Wars land fell flat.Other high notes of my recent trip: Oogie Boogie's bash was fantastic. The re theming of DCA as a whole from Beuna Vista Street to Pixar Peir- really amazing work. It never ceases to amaze me how cohesive the parks are becoming with the integration of Avengers Campus. Really looking forward to this. (Side note- Guardians: mission breakout- monsters after dark was such a great time! now that is a great re themed ride! Awesome sound track! I was against the tower of tower leaving, but I'm so impressed with the level of detail and high amounts of fun that ride became. Good on Disney!)The nostalgia and pulling of heart strings, family, that is what Disney does best. Coco shows and displays of culture, again, beautiful and great to see.Leave the thrilling screen rides to the other guys. In conclusion, I hope the controls for the Smugglers Run ride are more easy to control and that the second ride debuting early 2020 in Disneyland, Rise of the Resistance, has that wow factor. There is a reason Disney beats their competitors and I hope to see it again.",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

830,"Our family recently enjoyed a trip to Disneyland.  Our favorite rides included Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, Haunted Mansion Holiday (remake of the Haunted Mansion with Jack Skellington as ""Sandy Claws""), Hyperspace Mountain (a remake of Space Mountain with a Star Wars theme), Indiana Jones Adventure, Matterhorn Bobsleds (would not recommend if you have back issues), Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run), Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, Snow White's Scary Adventure, and Star Tours - The Adventures Continue.The park was themed for Halloween, and following the evening show, Fantasmic, they had a special show, Halloween Screams. The crowd levels for the two days we were at Disneyland were fairly robust. Having the Max Pass, our strategy was to endure lines in the morning, and then load up our afternoon with Fast Passes. Having the app to pull fast passes is so much better than the past where you had to haul it across the parks to pull the passes manually.Another strategy we used was riding single rider on some of the more popular rides. Our kids are older so it worked for us. For example, the wait on Hyperspace Mountain was 70 minutes, and the Single Rider wait was only 10 minutes. On our second day at Disneyland, we were able to pick up several fast passes that were released throughout the day, and we were able to hit 11 rides in about 3 hours.Millenium Falcon: Smugglers Run did not have fast passes, and you have to endure the line. My recommendation if it is 60 minutes or less, go! The ride was good, and it was not good enough to sit in the line again. The cue for the line seems endless, and it is deceptive as it winds in and out of the building. This area of the park is themed really well. It feels like you're in a Star Wars set. Storm Troopers paraded around the lines telling people to move along.With the change over of the Haunted Mansion, the lines for this ride are long. Get the fast pass. With the proximity of this ride to Pirates of the Caribbean, it made that line long as well (no fast pass for Pirates).The Max Pass did provide an advantage with pulling additional Fast Passes, and it also got you free photos from the photographers throughout the park. With the Max Pass you could also link ride photos to your account for free. While the photographers were not great, I did not have to carry my camera around the park.If I can say there is any downfall to the park, it is the food. One of the days we planned our lunch at Downtown Disney at Black Tap. Black Tap had great burgers and shakes. The two meals we had in the park were at Hungry Bear Restaurant and Alien Pizza Planet. We ate at Hungry Bear Restaurant because you could also get preferred seating for Fantasmic (which means you get to sit on the concrete while everyone else stands, and the view of the stage is probably the best - the other benefit is you don't have to save your spot 2 hours before the event giving you more time to enjoy the park). The food at Hungry Bear Restaurant was horrendous. My wife and I got the barbecue chicken that you could not even cut with a knife. My kids barely touched their food. Very disappointing when you pay over $100 for a meal for four. Alien Pizza Planet located next to Hyperspace Mountain was not too bad; not great. My family does enjoy getting a Dole Whip as a snack at the Tiki Juice Bar.We did not stay on site for this visit. We stayed at the Marriott Newport Coast Villas which was about 30 minutes from the park. We parked in Disney parking which was $25 a day, and they had a steady stream of buses to get you to and from the park. We stayed off site because we wanted a view of the Pacific Ocean. BTW - Checkout my review for Marriott Newport Coast Villas. It is definitely a great place to stay.Overall we enjoyed the experience and created family memories.

Don’t try to fit in too much in one day and make sure you and the kids have PLENTY of sleep, food, and did I mention WATER?? Not sugar, fried food, and soda (that’ll give you upset stomach and make you sluggish).Get an AirBnB nearby WITHOUT stairs (you’ll hate stairs after lugging your stroller and family around).Download the Disney app and get  your tickets downloaded on there and set up fast passes as soon as they scan you in! These go fast and you can hit up rides with low wait times (try Fantasyland) while you wait for your FastPass.Goofy’s Kitchen is worth letting your kids interact with the characters and get pics so you don’t have to wait in line forever when they see them in the park. Food isn’t anything to write home about, but it’s decent and there’s a good variety and a great way to fill up tummies to start the day.Which reminds me—make RESERVATIONS for EVERYTHING you want to do. Stuff books up fast and if you fail to plan you’ll be miserable.All restaurants (& Starbucks) give you free ice water in a cup, but lines are long—PLEASE have your group hydrate!If you buy a balloon 🎈have your child play balloon fairy on the last day and pick a child to give it away to (after asking their parents first of course).Go for comfort for you and the kids over cutesy.

Staff is extremely friendly, polite and professional always catering for customers.My biggest reasons for giving 4 stars are as follows:1. There are no power outlets to recharge your mobile devices. Yes, they will sell you battery pack for $30 US that you can swap at designated areas throughout the park, bit it is very hard to find conveniently located power outlet.2. Be prepared to pay $100s per day for food for a family of 4+.3. Food size is significantly smaller for the price visitors pay.4.

From security to the walk into the park, I was already hooked. We, well my wife had chosen the fast pass and photo pass (they both come as 1 option called the max pass) which is an extra $10 per person. This was a godsend as she used her app all day with the fast pass which allowed us quick boarding on the rides, we knew a time which we had to be at the ride and it was never longer than 5 minutes to get on (most normal ride queues were around 40 minutes today). You can only use 1 ride fast pass at a time, but as you can only go on 1 ride at a time, it makes sense. There were professional photographers all over the park and all the pics they take download onto the app on your phone (ours are yet to show, but can take up to 24 hours). All rides allowed you to take your bags with you and I could even use my GoPro for on-ride footage!Food and drink in the park is expensive. You can ask for a cup of iced water for free...ask any cast member if you’re unsure who or where to go for this. You can also ask for free badges at city hall, they say first time etc. Pins are everywhere, I’ll guarantee you’ll buy at least 1! My kids wanted every piece of tat available...$25 for a bubble blower, in the UK you can get these in the pound shop! But as it was Disney themed, it carried the Disney price...but I’m not moaning about it as I knew the price before I bought it!

876,Happiest place on earth is no lie. It is quite expensive but every time I go I feel that I spent my money well and I am always satisfied. I also feel that by making the park expensive it keeps it nice. The workers are always so kind and they always seem happy to be there. I asked a one of the churro stand workers if he liked his job and he told me he loved it because he got to be around only the happiest people in the happiest place all day. I loved that! This place seriously is magical and if you think otherwise there’s enough people in the park everyday don’t waste space and don’t come! California adventure is also a must. Spend the extra few bucks and buy the park hopper pass you will not be disappointed. Make sure to get a fast pass first thing in the morning for either Indiana Jones or Pirates of three Caribbean!

When we finally were able to get our reservation which was the earliest that we were able to get for space mountain. Find out that it was closed that we waited all day for! We were all the way on other side of the park. They need to have an update on their app stating when rides are down so people don't waste their time rushing to the ride.

Reservations are pointless if the park is going to be flooded with people so that you can even get on anything, lighting lane is expensive while also being basically pointless as you'll still have to wait anywhere between 30mins-8 hours for your lightning lane reservation, mobile orders are pointless because the lines are still insane for that as well so no matter what you'll be waiting at least half of the day, the food has skyrocketed in price, but has decreased in overall quality, and even the expensive fancy restaurants serve mediocre food. The rides are broken down half the time or are under renovation which sucks for those who don't go often and to top all of it off unless you go at the very opening of the park you will only get on perhaps 2-3 rides the entire day. Pirates and the haunted mansion can develop 3 hour lines in no time at all which is even more frustrating when the ride breaks down so then you have to evacuate off. You can't even have a sit down breakfast at most places because you either have to have put in a reservation or you have to sit outside whilst eating a mediocre gas station breakfast sandwich. I have been to disneyland over 750 times in my life and I have to admit that when I was growing up, disregarding nostalgia, disneyland was so much better its phenomenal how poorly the park has been managed. I applaud the workers for their dedication and hard work in trying to maintain the status quo, but unfortunately the park has become a money laundering pit where you can let your kids run around to burn off their energy. I hope the 300$-500$+ is worth it for you",2/5,2 months ago on  Google

Also, bough something else that I wanted to return on the same day and I got accused of having used the item already although it was still new with labels and receipt). I witnessed staff yelling at people and eventually us when the park closed because there was so much chaos going on and nothing was organized.The experience was so bad that I will be avoiding this park and focus on universal studios in the future because they deliver!!Ps: we went to Disney land in January 2022.",1/5,4 months ago on  Google

922,"In my 37 years, I have always had a positive experience at Disneyland and Disney World. However, in July of 2022 me, my husband and my parents left the park feeling very disappointed.Our first negative experience was dealing with the customer service phone line. When booking this trip we did not realize there is a capacity that Disney parks are still following due to Covid. I was under the impression you needed to make reservations to the park but we didn't realize it needed to be pretty far in advance. So unfortunately on my daughter's birthday we were unable to take her and rest of the family because it was booked. I called Disney just suggesting that they highlight and make it more obvious on the website that they are following strict capacity and make the policy more obvious, not in a place where you have to read fine print and click on a link. We have had been planning this trip for 1 year and this was not a clear policy. I also began to question how many were allowed in the park so I understood the policy better, they stated they could not give up such information. They then proceeded to lecture me and refused to take any additional questions about the Covid policy. It put a very bad taste in my mouth and their refusal to take suggestions and ownership really frustrated me. It was a completely different experience compared to when we last went in 2019.From there, we were able to get tickets the next day luckily for our daughters birthday.We did the genie pass and it did allow us to ride more of the rides.. if we wouldn't have gotten it, honestly I think we would have only gotten through 5 rides total. However, I am not a fan of this pass because it is very confusing, not user friendly and I felt as if I had to be on my phone more often which took away from the ""magical"" feeling. I wish Disney would have kept the fastpass cards that you swiped,  rather then having to stare down at your phone to plan the next rides.Another difference is that the staff at the park seemed very stressed out and grumpy. They were unorganized when asking questions about where certain things were located and we did end up wasting time looking for certain things because we were put on a wild goose chase. In turn, the negativity that was felt I believe rubbed off on customers. So much that my mother got purposely shoved in the back by an angry person that was in line thinking my mom was letting people cut into the line.The only reason I gave it 2 stars was the fact that my children did have fun,  but we hid a lot of the stress that was actually occurring around us. With this experience I would not suggest going there until they get the magic back in the park, do better maintenance on their rides so they don't break down as often, train the staff better to be friendlier and lower their prices. If they don't want to lower the price, they really should work on treating customers with a quality experience that disney used to be.P.S. The fireworks were amazing though!!",2/5,5 months ago on  Google

Disney can blame it on the pandemic, sure easy route. Maybe pay the employees more and shareholders/board members/CEO, VP, Senior MGT bonus packages less to keep your rides and food services properly staffed.Over crowed. Disney is at its prime in milking the lower and middle class of all their hard earned cash. Cash from paychecks, not dividend profits. Charging ball park prices for food & drinks is just one of many examples.Scam. Disneyland has been misrepresenting wait times for highly popular rides to lure unfortunate humans into paying an extra $20 on top of already paying for the lightening lane.Sad Faces.

After being treated at *every turn* like we didn't belong there, we are gutted. We don't even want to watch Disney movies anymore. They murdered the ""magic"" and trying to have fun inside the corpse of what is left is depressing to say the least, and its devastating to have spent so very very very much our time, energy, and the vast majority of what money we had in the world for something we felt would be worth it, to be left without so much a pleasant memory to show for it. Did you know that if you pulled the tag off your first special mouse ear hat you bought when you first walked in, they refuse to let you pay to embroider your name on it? Yep.

972,What can I say it's Disneyland!!!! Happiest place on earth. It's also the busiest place on earth. Expect long lines and be patient. We took our 5 year old son and he had fun. He didn't like waiting but he did great. The prices for food and drinks weren't that bad. I paid more in Vegas. We purchased the fast passes but I found the fast pass line was just as long sometimes then the regular line. Not sure if it's worth the extra $10 per person. We had a wonderful time.

Chronic pain, brain aneurysms and mobility issues, just waste your time going to each ride asking for a return time.  Anyway, yeah, Disneyland is not going to accommodate you unless you have sever autism, which I am glad they care about people with autism.  That is wonderful!  They could accommodate me with little ease and technology, they could make it so I could request return times, but no, they are not willing unless I pay lots of money.

976,"Disneyland is expensive! We all know that, but this new app makes it easy to budget and know what your costs are gonna be long before you get into the park (Note that my experience may not be applicable to those with children or dependents! Needless to say, Disneyland needs to work way harder making prices reasonable for families).We went on Monday in late-August, so it wasn't insanely crowded. Maximum wait times were 80 minutes (and we avoided those!) The ticket was $104 per person. I bought parking ($30) and then the Genie service ($20). The total ticket price per person (if split) was $139.The Genie service is definitely...a money-grab, to say the least. It is extremely effective and I could not imagine going through Disneyland without it. With it, the only ride I waited more than 40 minutes for was ""Rise of the Resistance"" (because you can't use the Genie service with it! You have to pay an ADDITIONAL $20, bleh). Without it, I can only imagine the frustration of waiting, each ride, for 30 to 60 minutes or more. I really think they should do away with it and return the Fast Pass, find ways to reduce Stand-By wait times, OR lower the price of the Genie service ($10? $15?).I will say, the Disneyland app saps the living nonsense out of my phone battery, though I managed to last until 10:30pm. Next time, I'll bring a portable battery and keep my phone on power-saving mode!The final thing I'll say about budgeting and pricing is, you can save a TON of money by reserving breakfast, lunch, or dinner at the more affordable restaurants in Disneyland...We did breakfast, total came out to $50 (including tip) and we were full until late lunch. Then we bought snacks or short bites, $5 - $10 average. Total money spent on food was $80.Putting money aside, the crowding was genuinely doable, the most intense of it was always in Fantasyland and after shows (refer to first paragraph for date of visit). So, we avoided.Character experiences? Amazing! Always flawless and exciting.Rides? Best one is Rise of the Resistance, hands down. Next, Space Mountain! Beware that during this time, many attractions are closed because Halloween attractions open up, like, a few days from the end of August. If you want Haunted Mansion, go earlier! Make sure to check when schools are back in session to avoid that summer crowding... 🤭I hope this helps newcomers and returnees to this new system figure out how to make the most of their trip!

Not all rides are covered (most important are not), plus rest of the resurs for which you can use it were closed.

I'd been before, but never during the holidays, and I absolutely loved how they had park decorated and some things changed around.Tips:1- If you're just going for one day, just choose one park to go.  Stay within walking distance of the park also- don't deal with parking.2- Definitely take small snacks and water- there is food onsite, but it's expensive (we did lunch in Toon Town, which wasn't too bad- I got hot cocoa with a souvenir cup that was actually really reasonable).3- Plan on extra money for souvenirs.  Nothing is cheap.  The fancy mouse ears alone are between $30-$40.4- Do not assume that staff will actually tell you to hold onto items during rides.  We were not aware that the Pirates ride had a drop and I lost the above-mentioned expensive ears, and we nearly lost my daughter's ears and my partner's hat.  I was extremely angry because there was NO warning.  I'm getting angry again, actually, thinking about it.5- Get the max pass thing.  It's worth it, for the photo downloads and for the fast passes.  That and the cup are the two things I don't mind spending money on.5YO loved the Small World ride and the carousel.  Partner loved Space Mountain (5YO not so much).Complaint- other than my damn ears getting lost, we didn't have much luck finding princesses.

If Disney can bring in a CEO who will respect the values that Walt Disney instilled instead of driving a profit first driven agenda, then I will become a pass holder again. They have dismantled their tram system, so the 30 minute walk from the parking structure to the front of the park is just another long queue in a day going from one long queue to another. The other main issue is that California is no longer a safe place to travel, and once we leave the boundaries of Orange County, all of Los Angeles county is probably the largest crime scene in all of America.

The park itself has so much to offer in everything already, but just the feeling that you get when you walk into each part of the park is just an indescribable experience. I remember the first few years of my life when I went, I just felt this magic that I couldn't find anywhere else. Even now that I'm reaching being an adult, it still feels as though I'm a young child every single time i visit. There is nothing more amazing than being able to walk down mainstreet at night, or through tomorrowland when all the lights are lit. Even just walking past New Orleans Square and into Critter Country is always thrilling and I can't even begin to describe what it's like without being there. I don't just highly recommend this incredible place, I urge you to go. Although it's a struggle in the money aspect of things, for me, it's always worth it. I as a 15 year old girl once raised enough money to take my family for two days, just so that I could go again. It has this sentimental effect on me that everything I do there becomes a core memory in my life. Even if it's just riding Splash Mountain 9 times in a row because no ones in line, or if it's just standing over in adventureland watching the fireworks because I couldn't get a good seat on mainstreet, it's always the same, wonderful, beautiful place that I will never get tired of experiencing.",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

My friend asked for a green milk, then without asking if our order was complete, she just gave a total. When we corrected her, she literally said,""Oh. Well she didn't say anything so."" My jaw dropped when she said that cause I been in customer service, you don't talk to customers like they are your friends. Anyway, after that she just glanced at me then looked back at my friend as if I was the problem when in reality, I was just waiting for her to ask if I was ready to order but instead she literally just stared.

The night parade in Disneyland was jaw dropping gorgeous. The castle was lit, all the lights were dimed and there were so many fireworks. The end was the bestfor me. I would say that although you have teenagers and aren't sure if they would enjoy going to a kids place, take them anyway. I had my moments were I loved something at some point and so will they. It could be anything. But they should also try to not be so gloomy. My mom obviously talked to us about sour moods. It really made me and my sister think about it and we decided we were going to try and enjoy. Worked pretty well. We would sometimes scream over things that excited is so much.

Even being able to bring in snacks and water really made it a great experience. I know we went during the busier time of the year but we were able to ride all of the big rides and some of the small ones. I can easily see how this is the happiest place on earth. I read lots of reviews on how expensive it is and we really didn’t spend a lot of money on food. I think if you go for snacks it’s not as bad money wise.

1123,"What helped us was downloading the Disney app which showed the real time wait for each ride and Fastpass distribution times.. you can also download a fast pass option for extra $10 for ticket so that you don't have to run to different areas of the park to get a FastPass physically but this seems to be not worth the money if you're not entering the park first thing in the morning or if you go during the holidays.Lots of rides quickly give out fast passes,  by 10:30 am Fastpass distribution was given for 4 p.m. also,  it didn't let you get another FP for 2 hours.We loved the small world presentation by projector outside of the ride. We didn't get to go on this ride because the wait time was over 65 minutes by 5 p.m. and the kids were really tired with it already being dark outside.There is no 7 p.m. parade during the holiday season.   We didn't know that and stayed worrying for it.  Apparently it's a different schedule during holiday season, there is a 1 p.m. and a 3 p.m. parade type of show which we didn't get to see.Also tickets at the booth were $124 for a 1 day pass during holiday season even though we were there on 11/20.They Disney app does not show correct descriptions for the ride requirements. they say all ages are welcome for rides that have a minimum height requirement. Be aware of that so that you don't get fast passes for your smaller children who won't be able to ride and miss an opportunity to get a FastPass for another ride for them.Overall it was a pleasant experience but not as impactful as I remember it 3 years ago. It seems like having such a large crowd during the holiday season made it more stressful getting from place to place and the line wait was much longer.",4/5,5 years ago on  Google

Just prior to leaving on this trip my wife mentioned that we have to fly to Florida in a couple years and take the kids to Disney World. At the end of our miserable Disneyland trip she informed me we will most definitely not be going to Disney World, or any other Disney property, for the rest of our days.

The park is just like Magic kingdom, except much smaller, which was perfect since it was less walking if you need to bounce from one side of the park to the other. The rides are just about all the same between the parks, aside from the bobsled at Disneyland vs. the dwarven mine carts at Disney world. A major stand out for young kids is the Mickey Mouse toonville. Such a cute spot for little ones to explore Mickey/Minnie/Goofy/Chip&Dales houses.

1148,"Disneyland was all that it was built up to be. My family of 6 (4 kids (13, 12, 8,6)) spent three days at the parks. Our 1st day was spent at Disneyland, our second at California Adventure (in the afternoon/evening we ventured into Disneyland to get on 2-3 rides in as we had the park hopper), and on our 3rd day we spent most of the day at Disneyland. In those 3 days we knocked out most of the more popular rides (Radiator Springs Racers, Star Wars, Peter Pan, Haunted Mansion, Galaxyof the Guardians, etc.), we got to see and take pics with many of the popular characters as well as most of the Princesses, got to see mot of the shows (with the exception of World of Color as we were told it would not resume until Sept.

Had we had a 4th day I'm sure we would have been able to get on some of the rides we were not able to and/or reride some rides, and meet some of the other characters and Princess, but 3 days was suitable, especially since we had 2 more days of Vaca in San Diego.

1151,"Obviously Disney is great but here's a review for important tips. 1. Set GPS to toy story parking lot, $25 for all day parking. The free shuttle takes you to front of park (less than 10 min ride). 2. After shuttle you go through bag check. First public restroom after arriving is past bag check. 3. The massive Starbucks in the shops and restaurants area after back check but before entering either park is the best place to buy coffee, never a long line, for both AM and PM fix. 4. Best food at Disney- fried chicken plate at Plaza Inn past the disney shops. That's pretty much the only thing I would pay money for and I've tried at least $600 worth of food over 8 visits. If your curiosity for Starwars land food is strong, best picks are the Oi-oi Puff, the Rontu Wrap, and the Jaaba Juice (blue milk wasn't as terrible as the reviews say). Ogas Canteen is still reservations only right now so book days before you go. 5. Most important tip... GO EARLY. Be past bag check by 8am. 8am-11am is the best window for Disneyland ride time and minimal crowds on a Saturday. We have done the Saturday Disney trip so many times and the days we arrive at 8am versus 9 or 10am make a massive difference and we have had way more fun and seen more rides coming at 8am and staying 4 hrs than arriving at 10am and staying all day!",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

We went for 2 and so didn't qualify for the discount. Nevertheless, we enjoyed ourselves immensely.  We stayed at the Paradise pier hotel and walked to the park. We opted for the 2 day 1 park max pass. The disney app makes it very easy to keep track of your fastpass and the photos. I encourage anyone to get the app. We did have some glitches with the app when we tried to buy the park pass through the app though.

He held the owl's legs tightly.Awaking from sleep, the owl stared, but could not escape. Immediately it screamed wildly. Its squeals and snorts infuriated the boy. He threw it on the ground.

Downside, people line the curbs an hour or more before the shows, making it difficult to get around with strollers when trying to access stores, food or restrooms in these areas. Disney has improved greatly in offering grab and go healthy snacks and on-the-go dining options are available all over the park. Last year and this most recent visit we experienced many technical issues with the rides and found ourselves getting out of line after waiting extended periods for fixes to be implemented...kinda a bummer when you've waited in line so long already.",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

The longest we had to wait in line was 40mins (without fastpass). Fast pass was not needed for most rides. We had a Park hopper ticket and visited both Adventure park and Disneyland on the same day.

1175,"The Disneyland Resort, commonly known as Disneyland, is an entertainment resort in Anaheim, California. It is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products division and is home to two theme parks (Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure), three hotels, and a shopping, dining, and entertainment complex known as Downtown Disney.The resort was developed by Walt Disney in the 1950s. When it opened to guests on July 17, 1955, the property consisted of Disneyland, its 100-acre parking lot (which had 15,167 spaces), and the Disneyland Hotel, owned and operated by Disney's business partner Jack Wrather. After the success with the multi-park, multi-hotel business model at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, Disney acquired large parcels of land adjacent to Disneyland to apply the same business model in Anaheim.During the expansion, the property was named the Disneyland Resort to encompass the entire complex, while the original theme park was named Disneyland Park. The company purchased the Disneyland Hotel from the Wrather Company and the Pan Pacific Hotel from the Tokyu Group. The Pan Pacific Hotel became Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel in 2000. In 2001 the property saw the addition of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, a second theme park, named Disney California Adventure, and the Downtown Disney shopping, dining, and entertainment area.",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

Great vibe!Highly recommend to book the “Regular Park Hopper Ticket with Disney MaxPass”. This will have both the Disneyland park and California Adventure Park with the SUPER useful MaxPass. Download the disneyland app and you can get access to the Fast Pass line in a window of one hour, and until the time arrives you will have time to do something else. the California park has great attractions. 1-day pass, from 10:00 to 11:00, I managed to cover the most interesting things. This requires fast walking and sometimes running. Maybe 2 days will be easier and less tiring but the price will approximately double. Expect some attractions to be under renovation. Also the big rollercoaster in the California park has stopped working suddenly after standing in line 30 min :(. expect things like that.I was looking mainly for the top experiences including in the main focus rollercoasters.

My wife convinced me to say something, while I was really focusing on having a good attitude so the kids would enjoy the day.We went to the Chamber of Commerce at Adventure Land, and “Carlos” I think was his name, basically could care less.  I explained that we flew from New Hampshire and this was really a terrible outcome after such an enormous trip.  He didn’t even show any empathy. When leaving we ran into Robert who saw we were troubled, explained our experience, and he was very kind. Spoke to a manager and he said everything goes through the chamber office.After the extra money for Fast Pass, we actually left with 3 or more Fast passes for any ride.  That was after using two of them. It would have been great to have a ride we could have made it to.  We should have at least gotten a refund for that extra expense.I know there is no guarantee about the rides, but this is incompetence and shows that they don’t take care of there rides.  I question the safety as well after this day, and whether the management of this Park is led by gross negligence.

1257,"What can I say, it's the happiest place on earth !!? We all had an amazing time on our Disneyland adventures. Everyone is pretty nice at Disney except the ""Disney police"" the Disney light patrol people who rope off certain areas for shows in the evening and yell at you if you accidentally walk the wrong way or stop walking for a second. They should probably work on that since we spend thousands (literally) to have a great Disney experience.  Also the people at starbucks need to work on not wasting product. We waited a really long time, 45+ minutes to get through the line only for the barista to make the wrong drink and when I told her she said ""oh"" and took the perfectly good drink and threw it right in the trash and proceeded to make me another wrong drink...at that point I just took the drink and left but usually outside of the park if they make the wrong drink they will not waste product, they will give you the drink rather than trash it...so that's a problem.This is the second time that I have visited in the last 4 years that the Matterhorn was closed for construction which was a bummer. Also Thunder mtn broke down twice in 2 days. Also they unexpectedly close down rides and areas at random times for parades etc, which is frustrating. I get closing off the road for the parade but I dont think they should be closing down rides and areas- like almost all of Fantasy Land. :/ also it makes it difficult when the ""Disney Police"" with their glow wands make it one way traffic  so you have to walk around the entire park to try to get back to your stuff because they wont let you walk 5 ft to get it or even to a bathroom. Also they definately take away from the whole fun Disney experience with how rude they are, again we are paying alot of money to be there. Also, why are you shutting down Toontown at 830pm!? That's lame especially because the rest of the park is open until midnight...Mickey was pretty rushed when we got our picture taken with him. He almost didnt even sign our autograph books. You guys should let characters spend at up to 5 mins to be able to take pics and sign-- it was literally 2 mins and the people were rushing us away.When you go to Disneyland expect long lines and to spend alot of money. It is worth the experience though! I wish that they would have vendors to go around and sell some snacks/food to people who are waiting in long lines like over an hour for certain rides-- just like in the ballpark.Overall Disneyland is one of the best experiences for the family. Fall is an awesome time to visit! Beautiful weather and decked out in Halloween decor.",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

My favorite all my years has been its a small world. Updated. We loved the WINNIE THE POOH ride but there is a joker working there on Thursday night. when ride was coming to an end we thought we were hitting one of the cars infront of us but we were jerked to a stop as we were being taken to end we were kept being jerked my question is if the kid standing there in charge of stopping us and pulling brake because it was not funny or if not him then ride has to be checked. We had a beautiful fun day this is truly the best place on earth. Love disneyland to much fun to explain lots to do.

They have a maxpass card, which puts a limit on you timewise as to how often you can reserve those fastpasses. So that's pretty useless as well in my opinion. Parking here is 20 dollars per day - what a ripoff. Overall, everything here is designed in a way to grab as much money as possible from you and give you as little as possible. I will make sure to never step my foot in this plce ever again. I reccomend you take your kids to any other amusement park. You won't have to wait for hours in line to hop on a ride, you won't be charged 20 bucks for parking, you might just be able to buy food without second thoughts and most importantly, your kids will have waaaaay more fun than here.

1304,"Our experience was far from what we expected during our Disney trip this time around. We loved going to the parks and had many,  many times but this time around we were quite disappointed. As several had mentioned, the Genie pass/ Lightning lane is absurd. We didn't mind purchasing it for an additional $20 per person but on top of that an additional $15 for certain popular rides was too much, especially since some rides were not allowing to book a time because no times were available or closed. Another set back was the staff,  not very friendly, inclusive very rude. I wanted to capture a photo of the Avengers items on display and one of the cashiers purposely walked and stood in front of the items knowing I wanted to take a picture. Other cast members we encountered seemed bothered by questions and didn't seem to want to help. Not sure if there's a lack of staff but the park also needed cleaner facilities. When we were having lunch outdoors, we saw a large mouse and believe me it wasn't Mickey. And this was in plain daylight.

In commercials they show Disneyland as a place of constant magic but since visiting I haven’t experienced that since before covid.

They say after COVID it’s been like this ever since!  the lines were over two hours long each ride! If you got the genie pass/fast pass you’ll be waiting about 45 minutes ! And paid $367 for three day hopper per person A lot of the ride in California avengers was canceled or broken down on us and if you were to buy the fast pass which is now call Geanne pass it’s $20 per ride per person only one time use! The drinks there are literally six dollars for a regular bottle of water a small one that you can buy at the store for literally two dollars everything is so over price! And the weather was extremely hot humid so I would definitely wait until fall don’t go around this time we just went there this past weekJune 20-23 2022 -then we reserved the lifesaver for Star Wars paid 235 but I didn’t realize I had reserved to go to California adventures that day so I couldn’t cross over so you can’t cross over until 1 o’clock so be careful about that! I recommend to get there early be there before 8am to get line for ride cuz your timing half! They open their doors at 8 AM and close at P 12 PM!! Otherwise yr be stuck in lines all day ! The first day we got there at 10:30 AM that Monday and all day we only got on three rides just stuck on waiting lines ! I would’ve gave it all five star!

If someone required medical attention there is no way anyone could get through to help.  People and staff were rude and pushy.  We only were able to go on only 3 rides because of our mobility.  No assistance at all.  After 3 days we then went to Universal.  All the staff was so helpful and friendly.  They went out of their way to help us.

I'm a HUGE fan of SW and it's almost like she doesnt exist anymore in the theme parks. Very disappointed especially since SW is the the 1st full length animated feature film WD made.

I enjoyed the different take on the attractions in common with DW as well as the experience of the unique ones, but I deducted one star for unprofessional staff. Staff stands around chatting amongst themselves and do not acknowledge guests unless interrupted. The lackluster staff is likely the reason for the trash and debris littering the walkways. The staff attitude is not engaged cast member, but instead that of disconnected cattle herder - no suspension of disbelief and certainly not magical. I deducted the second star because the FastPass experience is old school. Visitors are relegated to visiting dedicated kiosks to obtain a FastPass (only one at a time) unless you pay an upcharge to obtain them via the app. Furthermore, the CA park tacks on extraneous fees and taxes that are not required in FL.

I mean it has almost everything the Magic Kingdom has but has things they don't have! 1st. Is you can walk everywhere you need to go in 10 minutes or less. I don't mean inside the park, I mean walk from your hotel to the park(s) and to downtown Disney. 2. The staff or cast members were all super friendly and fun! Not one person yelled at us to move faster or tell us we were doing something wrong. 3. California weather is just way better! No rain, always sunny and always a cool breeze. In 7 days of 80 to 90 degree heat, I never broke a sweat! So the stuff they say about it being a dry heat is really true!4. So much to see in the area outside the park! I don't recommend leaving the Disney bubble without a tour guide. A private tour is what I recommend because it  an be scary outside those walls! It is full of tents for one thing. Homeless rate is horrible and you will be approached by beggars. People we're literally smoking meth and crack out in the open in broad daylight. You get the picture. It is located in a horrible neighborhood. But don't worry about it, they are a very secure park and have high fences and shrubs to hide the outside world!

Grew up vacationing here and never ever want to leave!So these are my best tips from when I visited in July 2017:-If you go on water rides, bring baggies to stash electronics in or a trash bag to throw your entire back pack into. I brought a pair of flip flops along specifically to wear on water rides and it worked out great! (Soggy sneakers are no fun; throw those in the trash bag to keep dry!)-Travel as light as possible and buy any souviners at the end of the day as to not weigh down your bag. The shops on Main Street and in Downtown Disney are open an hour after the park closes so you have dedicated time to shop!-Disneyland has water fountains hidden away from the main walkways in the lines for rides (like Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Space Mountain) so bring a refillable water bottle to save some cash!",5/5,5 years ago on  Google

1543,"Tickets are expensive, but totally worth the price if you plan in advance what attractions you want to ride so that you make the most of your time. I recommend installing the Disneyland app on your smartphone because it tells you how long the wait times are for each ride and if you purchase the Fastpass Max ($10 per person), you can get a Fastpass for any ride in the park from anywhere; you don't need to walk to the attraction to get the Fastpass. The app also shows you the location of the characters, which is helpful if you have children who are looking to get a photo or signature with their favorite character.I HIGHLY recommend you stay until the evening show that occurs around the lake in the center of the park; the entire performance was amazing.Rather than worrying about parking, my family and I simply called an Uber for our travel and they drop you off and pick you up in the same parking lot each time. This makes it easy to get to and from the park and was a nice way to avoid the headache of dealing with traffic, parking, etc.Dining is expensive, but you can find cheaper alternatives around the park, like a hot dog cart that has dogs for $6 each.Be prepared to walk A LOT if you plan on making the most of your ticket. I ended up walking over 8 miles (27,000+ steps) by the end of the day at Disneyland.Merchandise is expensive, so I also recommend going to a store like Target to buy some Disney t-shirts before your trip. That will save you a lot of money, especially if you are visiting the park with a number of people.With a family of 4, we were able to ride most of our desired attractions in 1 day, but if you're planning on also visiting California Adventure (about 100m away), I recommend buying a 2 or 3 day Park Hopper pass. This way, you can go between the parks as many times as you want each day. You have to go through security onces, but, after you've passed the security checkpoints, both entrances are very close to each other. I took the photo below from the exit of Disneyland, looking at the entrance of California Adventure for your reference.",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

1580,Our recent trip to Disneyland was the most miserable experience we've had in a long time. The park was way way way too crowded to be worth the price that we paid to get in. If there had been an emergency or incident there's no way they could have evacuated the park in a sensible amount of time. Value received for the amount of money we spent to get into the park was way out of balance.The park is very expensive and the food is even more expensive. A corn dog costs $9.25 which has to be at least a 3000% markup.They've made it so difficult to access the park that even though our hotel was only one block away it seemed we had to walk over a mile to get into the park. Security guards would not allow us to take our wagon into the park which meant I had to walk all the way back to the hotel with the wagon and then come all the way back again. (Throughout the day we saw other people with wagons.) Even after all of that time my wife was still in line to get her admission tickets.Waiting is the name of the game in Disneyland. You spend $100 or so to get into the park and then with all the waiting you're able to go on perhaps ten rides throughout the whole day so you're paying $10 per ride. When I'm at Disneyland I feel like the only thing important to Disneyland is trying to siphon as much money out of my wallet as they possibly can before I leave without giving me a solid value for my money. They are as bad as a casino.I think Walt would be very disappointed to see it today.I think Disneyland has come to offer too little value and too little service to be worth going to anymore.,1/5,5 years ago on  Google

Basically you are paying almost 100 usd per attraction. And it's not even Saturday or Sunday! And we do not live here, we came all the way from Europe for all this. The fast Pass doesn't help at all, it is complicated and you cannot reserve more than 1 entrance every 2 Hours. And the waiting times outside all the attractions are drastically underestimated.

We don't have kids so we decided on the most expensive passes that have no black out dates and free parking. You do get a lot of perks as an AP, Annual Pass holder.We usually go every other weekend and spend a few hours there.I do reccomend if you're not an annual pass holder that you do the max pass. It's only $10 per person per day and you get to do fast passes all day. In addition, free photo downloads on the Disneyland app that the photographers take and on the rides. As soon as you get to the park select your fast pass right away. We always do the rides that have longer wait times.If your going to California Adventures you definately have to do a fast pass for #1Cars and #2 Guardians. Cars line is always the longest and fast passes do run out quickly.Dont forget there is a lot more to do at Disneyland aside from the rides!!!",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

We had the Magic Key annual pass and there were many issues with it. Everything is overpriced, and I imagine people expect that, but it’s getting worse and worse. It may require talking out a small personal loan to afford it nowadays. I don’t think Walt Disney would be happy with some of the cons. When you buy the lightening lane you can only use it once per ride, which used to be a FREE service. What a ripoff! Since pass holders have been called “unfavorable” for attendance I guess I’ll spend money elsewhere! The quality is so poor right now; it’s sad. No renewal for me.

Well unless you're  that kid that wants everything in the souvenir store and your mom says you can only have one.I travelled here from north California and Disney does not disappoint no matter the language. Disneyland is made of 2 parks similar to the Dosneyland in Miami one park is mostly studio shows and 4d rides. While the other park is the typical theme park with tons of rides, princess everywhere and your favorite characters smiling and waving at you.The park is small enough that you could possibly ride the majority of the rides all in one day  but you'd likely have to skip the shows and the character meet and greets. Now if you have 2 days and the money to do it, you can definitely visit both parks and do all Disney has in that time.The worse part of this visit was the transportation. If you have a car or a rental, drive. Lots of hotels around the disnyland.

We downloaded the new Disney app. We were able to access our passes, order food, utilize the Max Pass (extra $10 but worth every $$). We got all the free pictures Disney takes and downloaded them right to my phone. It was the best way to navigate and see wait times. There wasn't any crazy running around to get the next fast pass and/or try to find fastpass stations. We would sign up on my phone for our next fast pass ride while we are waiting in line. It saved us soo much time and it was soo very helpful. Trust me, it's easy to use. We were able to maximize our time for the one day we had to spend there.

Also the gift shop stores are also very pricey. The best thing to buy is just a keychain and skip out on the rest. Very expensive merch. Wish I could say this is where the magic happens but it's just alright. It's a beautiful place to visit.

1645,"This is a guide or sort of a guide to the people who are visiting Disney land LA or California Adventure Park for the first time and haven't done a lot of research and I shall be sharing the mistakes that I have made and give you tips and this is for my Scandinavian friends also.1. Shoes, Shoes,SHOES!! :Prepare to walk a lot because oh lord you are just going to do that OR be smart and take the monorail or the red tram that they have, But I still recommend a shoe that can keep your feet comfy and doesn't make your feet sore after long walks, I started at 15:00 and walked untill 22:00 and was walking with my sandles, that was a mistake and I got water spores on my feet which is not fun.2. Fast pass makes the whole experience last :When I came to America and heard that you can reserve times for a specific ride in Disney land, I was confused.... Untill I went there, The lines are so long and ＲＩＤＩＣＵＬＯＵＳ　that you get discouraged from the start, So I beg of you, even though it might not seem logical in the first place, Get the fast pass so things can go mutch smoother for you or your family, You can get it via the Disneys app or on the ticket booth when you are purchasing the regular and also I recommend coming as early as possible to make sure you see everything.3. Ｓｎｉｆｆ　ｓｎｉｆｆ　.... 🤢🤢🤢 :I hope I can give you an image of how many gag reflexes I had when ever time I passed a food cart that sold churos or something, The park warns about this at the entrance but the warning sign is right below your legs at the entrance. So if you have a weak stomach or sensitive smell, I suggest bringing some sort of mask, but if you say that you can take it and with stand the smell then go ahead.I also recommend buying water and sunscreen for the family or on your own and I also recommend bringing a backpack or anything that you can carry your stuff. If the stuff is weighing you down, As a last resort, You can rent lockers in adventure Land although it's expensive, Small locker costs 7 dollars and I think the bigger ones cost 15 dollars.4. Phat/Fat wallet = Thanos Gauntlet :Be prepared to spend a pretty penny, I spent 185 dollars and I choose the park hopper perk, Everything is in my eyes, Is expensive and the Disney or Mickey Mouse Hat cost $25 each, That's a lot for a hat that has 2 round cloths attached to it.Now on the food side, If you are a Christian Or an atheist, It shouldn't matter the source of the food, Now as for my Jewish and Muslim friends, I don't trust it to be Kosher or Helal So I recommend packing your own snack or food with you trust full heartedly as I don't trust the source of the food supply that Disney land gets. Now if you where to lose your ticket like I did, Please don't throw away the receipt that you got from the ticket booth, Keep your receipts and tickets in a place that's secure yet reachable.5. lost in happy land :I highly recommend grabbing a map before you dive deeper in the park as it might have some help, I'v seen 2 teenage girls using there phone and on that phone there was the parks map ready on hand (and I think it tracks you and tells you where you are, Correct me if I'm wrong, Not 100% sure on that )I have lapped at least 2-4 times in the Pixar Fare and didn't know which way is which, This is due to lack of food that I didn't eat because I didn't trust the sources and I did drink a lot of water.... At the cost of 4 dollars each for a bottle but the water cups are free if you ask for them.Lastly 6. Do or don't  go hardcore nor PARKcore :Pick parkhopper if you are going to buy the 2 day ticket already, And I do recommend at least 2 days to see the entire thing... That being said if your alone or with your Girlfriend or friends, You can try the park hopper for 1 day but then I very highly recommend the fast pass again, Because the LIINNNES.But overall I  did some what enjoyed myself!",4/5,4 years ago on  Google

1650,"Drove halfway across the country and spent hundreds of dollars only to wait in two hour lines of rides that got shot down—literally spent half my day waiting in lines only for the ride to shut down—resistance, Thunder Mountain, Splash mountain, Indiana Jones, just to name a few.Almost every experience my family and I had with staff was completely poor. Throughout the day, the staff members treated us with contempt and belligerence. One example was when a worker at the Matterhorn barked at me for trying to get my son, as we crossed over the line before the loading point. He said, “did I tell you you could go over there?” It’s like, bro, I’m just trying to keep my kid from running off. Another instance was when I was trying to park my stroller at Thunder mountain. The lady supervising the parking was barked at my family in her shrill voice and said, “YOU NEED TO PARK ALL THE WAY DOWN!!!!” As if it was obvious (it absolutely wasn’t). Then there was the constant nagging by staff members as I’m trying to walk to the exit, telling me to move, while I’m just trying to take little stops and manage my kids.I’m certain that Disney overbooked the park, so every ride line was ludicrously long. I wait in a 90 minute line for a 3 minute ride for my 4 year old child to look up at me and say, “is that it?” You can’t order food in person at virtually any restaurant, so you have to order hours in advance, so you can expect to miss your food window if you’re in a line for a ride.My expectations were high but my experience was an absolute, unmitigated disaster.",1/5,7 months ago on  Google

We didnt notice until later but we spent over an hour just grabbing pictures & autographs of the Disney characters as they pop up around the park grounds. The lines are longest for Mickey & Minnie of course.Also, don't forget your money because it is going to cost you some dough. From the entrance fee, to food & souvenirs, you are bound to lighten your pockets for sure.

For example... weather and population are frequently complained about... “too hot...too crowded”... but the truth is that these things don’t matter. Although it’s everyone’s dream to be at the parks alone, it just doesn’t happen, and yet the experience is still out of this world. From the fast pace rides to the “kidde’s”, there is someone everyone can enjoy. Food is expensive, but that’s one negative thing against the countless positive.

1736,"Star Wars Land!!!!!AMAZING!Well we were one of those crazy people that paid an exorbitant amount of money to stay at Disney's Grand Californian Hotel on Thursday night May 30th in order to be one of the FIRST VISITORS to the land of Batuu on the 31st and let me tell you there are really no words to describe it.We were treated like royalty at The Grand Californian from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  On the 6th floor Club Level where we stayed they include meals and snacks in the VIP Lounge and since we left the hotel at 4:30am on May 31st for Star Wars Land and missed breakfast they extended our Club Lounge admission even after our check out time and allowed us to eat lunch in the Lounge after we arrived back from Star wars Land!Just another example of you get what you pay for when it comes to Disney!We arrived at the entrance to Disneyland at 4:40am and joined the other several hundred people there, some waiting to get early entrance into the park to buy limited edition Star Wars Land merchandise that would be sold outside of the Land, and others waiting, like us, for the FIRST slot of the day, 8am-12noon.We were allowed entry into the park at 4:50am and taken to the Launch Bay at around 5:45am.  There we could buy limited edition Annual Passholder items such as tshirts and pins.After we left the Launch Bay we waited with the other die hard fans nearby Nemo and Space Mountain until 7:15am, when we finally began our descent to Star Wars Land!This was like no other experience ever.  Everyone walking with their phones in the air, recording their experience, with lots of hoots and hollers along the way, until we arrived at the bridge.At 7:30am we all began the countdown from 10 and then...we were released!!!We were greeted by maybe 100 VIP's in suits and stakeholders and executives on our way in, congratulating us and high fiving us, eager to see how their biggest fans enjoyed the new land.Adrenaline was high and there were literally tears of joy in the crowd.There is a bit of a walk to get into Star Wars Land and so you DO feel like you are in a Galaxy far, far away.Once you are in the land there is no indiciation that you are even in Disneyland anymore.The thing that makes Star Wars so believable is that it is rooted 85% in reality.The bazaar is modeled after markets in Istanbul and Marrakesh.The landscape is modeled after the Petrified Forest in Arizona.So it FEELS right bcus there's always something you can put your finger on that feels familiar.Our first stop was Savi's Workshop to make our own authentic light sabers.  The price tag is hefty at $200 each but well worth it if you're a fan.  You get to choose all your own parts in the making of it, including the crystal color, and there is also an amazing ceremony after you compete it.The whole process takes about 15 mins.The food has the Batuu names, not the English names.For example chicken is called Tip-Yip.And the food is served in non-disposable metal/heavy plastic bowls and the silverware is also a heavy metal, not plastic.The cast members speak and act in their roles.For example my son was told to ""hide his weapons bcus the Resistance was spotted.""Like many of the blogs have said, there was no mention of the words Star Wars in Star Wars Land.  Just a planet named Batuu.The ride is like a huge video game where you actually get to fly the Millennium Falcon.   Due to it being Opening Day we were only allowed to go on it once, but that was ok since there was so much more to do!We bought the $8 blue and green milks.At first I didnt much like them bcus it was a taste sensation I have never experienced before.But then it grew on me and I wound up loving them.They almost had a floral essence to them and the textures were a mixture of a slurpee with a milkshake.The blue one is sweeter than the green and I actually liked the green one better.We didnt have time to visit the Cantina or to make a Droid on this visit...but next time.This was an amazing experience that we will never, ever forget.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

You must use the pass first then be able to sign up for more passes.-Also ordering food ahead of time is not worth it because so many people do it and the line for pick up is just about as long as the regular line.,5/5,7 months ago on  Google
1777,The happiest place on earth. Wonderful place fun time for everyone big and small. I went during the week so the park was not as congested and it was raining in the morning ☹.  The people were super friendly and if you needed help people would show you where to go.The only down side to Disney is the price.  They have gotten out of control with pricing.  Be prepared to fork over some cash if you are taking a family.,5/5,4 years ago on  Google

1781,Wonderful Experience.  Super fun California Adventure is great too only reason for 4 stars is the prices on things has gotten a little bit too high and we didn't feel like we got the same value out of the Genie pass that we did on the previous fast pass system.

Rather than rushing me to figure it out so they could start the ride, a cast member came over and showed me a different way to get in the rocket. He also helped me get back out after the ride.Disney knows what they're doing.

1800,"Sadly Disneyland has changed and not for the better. Though they did have few employees that worked their magic to be kind and joyful people, sadly this time around we experienced what no one should especially at Disneyland. RACISM amongst the Disney cast members, never before have my family and I experienced so much hateful stares from White casts members because we are of Hispanic decent. Starting with a white older male that worked on Splash Mountain, we had a wheelchair and stroller and entered through the back entrance. He left his post from managing the ride to tell us to move our stroller because it didn't have a red wheelchair sticker, but we had a wheelchair, the White people in front of us didn't have this red sticker, yet they were not told to move their stroller because they were white. We moved the stroller, but the stares and looks that man gave us were of superiority, and discussed that he had to lower himself to even speak to us. We were in shock to see someone working for Disneyland with this attitude and hatefulness. It was like the some of the white cast members, just work their for a paycheck and feel that Disneyland should only be for privileged white people. On several occasions my niece wanted to take pictures with dressed up cast Members, starting with Captain America in California Adventures,  he pleasantly stopped and took pictures with these white kids in line waiting to meet him as soon as he saw Hispanic children my son and nieces he didn't have time to take pictures, if we wanted to talked pictures we would have to follow him to the other side of the park in order to do so, and again with the discussed stares towards us, we were in shock, again another racist cast member, he was too good to take pictures with us. This happened with several other white cast members Minnie mouse in California as well, through out the parks and we as a family knew that so many cast members feel that they were too good to work for a company that has to serve different races and creeds. Sadly only a few cast members made it a memorable time, starting with a pleasant Hispanic man, I am sorry I didn't write his name down he was from Mexico and worked in the parking garage he walked from his post all the way towards( half the parking garage, with a smile on his face) us to tell us we could park at a bit more assessable parking spot down stairs, he could have kept quiet and said well they are already parked who cares, he did. For that we were greatful. We thanked him kindly, but didn't want to walk all the way back to move the car. The other gentleman that just made us smile was the man who worked on the grizzly water ride in California Adventures, everyone coming off the ride he would chant and clap his hands just pumping up everyone,  happy all around smiling and fun. They both gave us the best memories on this trip. Yet our hearts are sadden that Disney tolerates this from their white employees. Maybe no one has spoken up, too be honest, I don't know where else to vent or even begin to express how awful some cast members were, we tried our best to enjoy the moment, we did the best we could but look out for the Racist Cast Members at Disneyland!!!!!!",2/5,7 months ago on  Google

Just some robots with lights and very few characters on the floats!!No fireworks until summer we were told!!Disneyland was just a shopping mall with too much people!! Horrible!

The Toys ride where you do your shooty pooty rootin tooty is just so satisfying.  Then we went to the main park.  AND THAT IS WHEN THE PARTY STARTS.  SPACE MOUNTAIN WAS AMAZING.

The staff that was escorting them around flipped  out and yell at a guy trying to get a picture while they walked by and yelled at him get out of the way...shameful.

I highly suggest you do not miss Indiana Jones. The food was delicious and I got to eat the grey stuff...it was delicious! Ha. I do wish so that they had a bit more theme foods like you see in videos about the Disney park in Tokyo, Japan. The only real damper on the day which I know was out of their control was that Haunted Mansion broke down. It was one of the main attractions I wanted to see at Disneyland. This is the time of year when they switch it over to have the characters from A Nightmare Before Christmas.

Exploring these parks will require some shoes with a great amount of comfort for walking and waiting in long lines.

Disney doesn't care that we already paid $150 to enter the park, they want to make the extra $20 each ride on those lightening passes. I mentioned to the guy handling the line that it was unfair.

My fiancé doesn’t like it as much, but I still go like once a week. I can’t think of a better place to be in California.

Some of the dark rides were very loud, had to cover the babies ears but otherwise the park was super clean, cast members were very friendly and helpful. We loved genie+ and LL to skip rides since we were there for such a short time. DCA might actually have been our favorite park, even though DL holds serious nostalgia for me going as a kid. Fantasmic, World of Color and the Electrical Parade were amazing! Radiator springs racers was down, but cast members brought out fun games and things to do (corn hole, checkers, etc.).

They implemented the reservation system at Disney supposedly limiting the amount of people that were allowed to be in the park, however the amount of people at the park was over and above what I have ever seen.  We wait for three hours in a line for Space Mountain, the standby time was 45 minutes.  The new Lightening Lane and Genie passes are a waste of money.  Every time we would try to use the Lightening Lane pass, there were hundreds of other people that were there at the  same time, making a wait even in the lightening lane of sometimes over 45 minutes.  The rides were constantly breaking down and there is nothing they will do if you have a lightening lane reservation for a ride that breaks down.  I am extremely disappointed in the direction that Disney has gone.  I don't believe that this is what Walt would have wanted.

With that said, this one is the original which makes up for the size and then some.3. All the dark rides.

We saw the Cars ride go up to 165 minute wait. If you enjoy standing and waiting to do things, you'll love this place.Food was overpriced for tasting like it came off a Gordon's freezer truck. Many food places require you to buy through the app which means you can't just walk up and buy food. You'll have to wait 15, 30, or even 60 minutes before your food is ready. It's a gong show and I chose not to buy many things I would have because it was quicker and easier to leave the park and buy food elsewhere than it was to buy through the app. I wanted to get a swirl ice cream cone in Radiator springs and walked up to the stand where the woman was standing, not doing anything, and was told to order from the app which said I would wait 15 minutes. Went over to the register where she said I could order and they weren't able to place my order. I kept my $5.29 and bought ice cream at the A-Mart on the way back to the hotel.The Genie+ and lighting lane are not worth it. You can only reserve 1 ride at a time in the lightning lane and you have to wait until after you redeem that ride to reserve the next one. So you can maybe get a couple of rides on it, but the times keep getting pushed because the times keep getting pushed later and later. After waiting for half an hour, you get on the ride, and the experience maybe lasts 2 minutes. Ask your partner if this is enough time to have a good experience.Speaking of rides, they were often broken down. We came early (got to the gate at 7am) to try and ride Indiana Jones as well as the The Big Thunder Mountain rollercoaster. Indiana Jones ride was not open and the roller coaster broke down 10 minutes before we were about to board. This is pretty much how the experience goes. We left to go ride Mr. Toads Wild Ride and 10 minutes into waiting it broke as well. Rides are always down and then up and then down and then up.When riding the Pinocchio ride I was reminded of his journey to Pleasure Island and I feel like Disneyland has become just that... and I felt like the Jackass in the cage for going.Most of the park is food and gift shops and standing in crowds. If I'm going to spend $2500+ dollars on a vacation, I might as well fly to Switzerland and go to the real Matterhorn.",2/5,6 months ago on  Google

1972,"I normally love Disneyland. But, this last trip has ruined it. The staff are RUDE! I was constantly getting barked at. You can't do this nope don't go here or there. Followed the parade out to go back to the other side of the park from small world and the staff basically tried to force us out an exit that was full of people trying to come through which resulted in us striking several people with our stroller (image salmon going upstream and your trying to walk down). On the jungle cruise the one cast member at the ride exit got an attitude about telling me to not step over the crates after i had already did it and scoffing loudly at my family for not listening to his delayed instructions. I tried to buy a balloon on main Street stopped a guy with a bunch of balloons and he refused to sell me one because I needed to follow him to the end of the street so I did and then he immediately started helping other customers turning his back to me. The park was so packed that I was shoulder to shoulder constantly with other people. My son never got to meet mickey since each line was about 60 kids deep and then oh wait a cast member would rudely tell you that mickey is busy and this is the end of the line and stand there. The older man cast member outside the cantina was the most helpful. Don or Doc. He helped me with the app and got me into Olga's cantina. Also, our server at the blue bayou was the best. Super friendly and courteous. (Also older employee) They are what im used to seeing in employees at disney. Not the power tripping gen z staff thats currently taken over. They to me made the magic of disney disappear and seem more like I went to six flags. Or i decided to go to mcdonalds instead or chick fil a.  Overall get the lighting pass. It was the only thing that made our trip better. But remember that you can only use the lighting lane every 2 hours.",2/5,6 months ago on  Google
1973,"It had been 4 1/2 years since my family had been to the parks. Let me tell ya, no it is not the same as it once was 10 years ago, and yes disney has become very greedy, and yes it was very crowded as we expected, BUT we did not let any of that stop us from having a great time! We were there the first week of May Monday through Thursday and did a 4-day 1 park per day pass. Even with the star wars nites going on crowds were still bearable. It was a bummer to not have pirates open while we were there, that being one of my all time faves.I must mention my family did pay the extra $20 per day per person to get Genie+, and I really don’t know why people are complaining about it so much. (Perhaps thats because we were very familiar with the previous fast pass system?) It was SO WORTH IT!! I guess because we had genie+ it didn’t feel quite as busy. We were able to ride everything that we wanted. No we did not pay the extra extra money for the lightening lane for Rise, Webslingers, or Racers, but there really was no need. The two times we rode Rise, the posted wait time said 90 minutes but never waited more than an hour so we were pleasantly surprised with that. I wouldn’t waste your money on individual LL. I personally don’t think it’s worth it. We rode Racers probably 6 times throughout the trip by doing single rider. No you’re not riding with your party but it’s still a lot of fun and you can ride it a couple times in a row if you wanted. Anywho with that being said Genie+ is a really great way to make the most out of your day. It’s basically the old fastpass/maxpass system except everything can be done on your phone which is quite convenient. Only downside is that you must now pay to have that convenience and the disneyland app drains your battery like no other. I highly recommend Genie+ though, just be sure to get familiar with the service before your trip!I read some reviews of people complaining about how food prices have gone up while food portions have shrunk. I really don’t have much to complain about there. Food prices I think have gone up maybe a dollar for most things but I don’t really have much to say on that. I personally thought the food portions were perfect. I wasn’t a big fan of the mobile order system they have. It’s dumb.We were happy to have World of Color back! We were able to get into the virtual queue (which is ridiculous) and the show was absolutely magical! Much better than I remember. And for the Main Street Electrical Parade we didn’t really bother trying to see that. People were saving spots 2 1/2 hours before the parade even started for both parade times. That was a bit of a bummer but not enough to ruin our day.With everything said, we overall had a very magical trip and I can’t wait to go again! ✨Side note: We are a family of 6 with everyone being 17 and older.",5/5,7 months ago on  Google

You’ll be paying  all this money just to feel like a savage fighting to get on any rides or see any events . There’s way too many people ! They got rid of the fast passes ! They now have lightening passes which they don’t tell you the cost until you’re there and on the app. Which they were trying to charge for only two rides ($60each on top of the $180. We waited to see the princesses 2 hours under the hot sun. My daughter was only able to go on 4 rides since getting there at 9am! Each an hr + long wait. It was ridiculousl. Imagine all these poor 1+ year olds having to wait that long and seeing them suffer . They now make you stand to watch the firework show .. we stood for two hours because that’s how you can get any type of spot for anything .characters are hardly walking around .. just being in there counting how many people there are not to have the perks of seeing characters is upsetting . Once a character comes a line forms and after 10 people they say  “ok they’re done! “ It’s not the same!! And the experience is not the same. It’s not the magical place it once was and I remembered . Save your money and head to Disney world or another theme park but you will be disappointed going here. I’d give 0 stars if I could. Only highlight was the lion king show.

Smugglers Run is pretty intense and not good for young kids at all. It’s way too hard for anybody whose not into video games. My daughter and I got the pilot roles and she’s 7 and not into video games. Needless to say she had no idea what to do and I ended up leaning across the front and doing both the pilot roles.

My son was sad that spiderman “didn’t want to read his book” as he would say it himself. I am not trying to be a pain or cause trouble but as a mother it upset me to see my son get his feelings hurt by his hero.  I am sure my son is not the only kid was made to feel this way.

The lines are an unavoidable evil, despite the help of ""fast passes"". Make sure you get ""park hopper"" passes so that you can bounce between both parks, helping utilize the time between waits. Pace yourself with the treats - a dole whip float, jalapeño pretzel, a churro, and a corndog were my day. The updated ""Hyperspace Mountain"" is the longest wait, but one of the best rides at the park. The Hollywood Tower Hotel was the biggest disappointment  - an exceptionally long wait for minimal thrills. Also, don't shy away from the ""kiddie"" rides like Ariel's Underwater Adventure ride.

The whole park is massive with California adventure and downtown Disney so everyone was spread out. We went on all of the rides and the most we waited was an hour which wasn’t too bad I felt. I would avoid the summer next time and come in their spring as the heat in the long lines were draining.

I love the smaller attractions you cannot find in Disneyworld. Although several rides are similar to its Orlando counterpart, the experiences are different, so they are absolutely worth the time to explore.  The park is very easy walking distance from loads of great hotels at reasonable prices.  The night time shows are good ( Disneyworld night time shows are spectacular!)   Like all Disney fans, I suggest going mid week and getting there early.  The Fast Pass system at Disneyland is different from the Disneyworld.  Be sure to learn about it.  I think the one at Disneyland is much better as it allows EVERYONE to get their fast passes ONLY when they are in the park and can do them from their smart phones.

Their cast members live in California & we all know California people are only about Me, Me, Me and they are not happy, cheerful, courteous, kind or  friendly to their guests. If you want this from Disney, then you need to go to Florida.Compared to FL, the CA Disney Parks do not do much to dress them up for the Holidays. They throw a few lights up here & there, but NOTHING compared to all the Disney parks in FL.Disneyland & California Adventure are ungodly expensive and NOT worth the money they charge. Even if you pay for a Fastpass (Genie Plus) they will still charge you up to $25.00 additional  on certain rides @ certian times.The ONLY thing that Disney is concerned about is the all mighty dollar... in their eyes, they can NEVER take enough of your money away from you.Past Review:We were Season Pass Holders, but just NOT worth the money. Every time we go, at least 3 to 4 rides are always down. ""Cast Members"" are just not friendly & happy like they are in Orlando @ Disneyworld. Always dirty with trash on the grounds.

2138,"My home away from home! I always enjoy visiting Disneyland. All the cast members are friendly and inviting, and honestly it’s a place where you can truly be a kid at heart. The prices are high, but that’s most places now days. I do wish there could be a separate parking pass we could buy since we bought the California Flex Passes which didn’t include parking. That’s really my biggest concern. I love the fact that we are allowed to bring food and drinks inside the park. I usually make sandwiches prior to going to save some money.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google
2139,"As an avid Disney fan, I honestly have to say you might want to wait until later in the year (2022) to go to either LA park, if you have a choice.  Disney and California Adventure are really not fully operational and they are struggling with staff shortages, a poorly thought out Genie Plus system, COVID rules/lack of rules, mobile ordering that is still ""in beta"", and a Disney app, which is necessary for everything, that is just not functioning correctly.If you do decide to go now, you should expect all rides to periodically be shut down at random, which I attribute to staffing issues. You might even struggle to even get a warm meal (mobile ordering was down yesterday for a couple hours) - and many places don't take cards or cash (?) so plan for longer days and stock up on snacks when you can.   You might have to order basic things like ice cream an hour ahead of time, and don't commit that you will ride any specific ride to the kids.  I would recommend that you make sure you spend a couple hours, at least, watching videos on how to navigate Genie Plus and the new systems ahead of time, the staff doesn't fully understand it yet - so waiting to you get to the park is not the best idea.  Make sure you book sit down reservations several weeks out - and for heavens sake, make sure to arrive when the parks open, as everything books up.  Also, the wait time for customer service is 30 minutes to get them on the phone, and making changes to reservations and tickets is a brutally long process and refunds will take weeks? Do your research and don't expect to be able to make changes easily after your plans are made.By the end of the day yesterday (Saturday of a 3 day weekend) I could really tell the staff was pretty fatigued and a little cranky, so try to be understanding.My biggest complaint is I was face down in my phone for a large amount of the time trying to just do basic tasks that was so much easier a couple years ago. I'm sure things will be better in a few months, but its hard recommending these parks when Six Flags, Universal, and Knott's Berry, etc. are so much easier and less stressful as we get out of the pandemic.",2/5,10 months ago on  Google

I used to not mind the fast pass lane as  it didn’t seem this obvious how much more they favored that line.Disney has an amazing product and brand but their corporate greed proves they only preach about equality but only truly care about their own bottom line.

2184,"7E2C01: Again great happy place. I thought their stroller management at first tram stop on the Disney downtown site and at the elevators was very poor going back home last night around 10:15 PM or so. The Disney cast member did not ask the folks with the strollers to form a single que. Everybody was just bunched up after the first 3 or 4 strollers. There was plenty to room for strollers to line up but no body was guiding the patrons. At the Mickey and Friends elevators, patrons typically form single que but one of the Disney employees came and split the line into two, one each for each elevator. That caused a bunch of scramble and some folks lost their position and some folks gained their position. Then the Disney employee at the elevators started letting people go on the elevator from the other elevator's  que. Not sure what the strategy was. In summary, we enjoyed our day at the parks but the return was not so good.7E1-81A: Great place to have fun with grand kids and kids.

We went to Smuggling Run instead, with an estimated wait time of 55 minutes. This wait was quickly found to be unrealistic as our group of 8 children sat nearly doubled the estimated time due to the MASS amount of lightning lane goers. I get they are prioritized but the standby lane crawled and crawled, and several parties even elected to walk out after waiting an hour to find out the line never, and I mean never stopped looping around as we saw the lightning lane parties smiled and walked past the tired standby lane.All in all, I felt Disney honestly missed the mark for us, given how much ticket prices are.",2/5,9 months ago on  Google

That means 2-3 rides before lunch and maybe another 2-3 before you leave. Also some rides were so jerky that they hurt my back. I can handle G forces and heights, but unnecessary jerkyness in a ride is either a maintenance issue or a design issue so for that reason alone I don't see myself coming back here.",4/5,7 months ago on  Google
2232,"So, Disneyland used to be my favorite place in the world as a kid, now because of this new Genie app. I will never come again. The app was glitching n having trouble our whole 5 day stay! We were kicked out of the lines for rides n we were sent to guest services numerous times with no resolution. Then on 1 of our visits to guest services we talked to ""Nathan"" an I.T. guy, he had to take a video of our wife's phone. The app would not book our rides even tho we had a lighting pass 🤦🏻. Furthermore our app would reserve different parks as well. I even had the chance to talk to a Manager ""Chad"" who was respectfully disrespectful. Talk to me like I was a liar and  once again referred me to guest services. That's when I met Sharon from guest services. She is an Angel and deserves a raise. She helped out more then could be asked. The reason there is even a star in this review! Thanks again Sharon!",2/5,7 months ago on  Google

2239,"I took the family to see Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, specifically for the Millennium Falcon ride, thinking it would be somewhat close to all the reviews I had read online.  Being a huge sci-fi fan I had high expectations.  My first mistake was going here over the Christmas break along with many thousands of other folks.  My second mistake was not getting to the park until mid morning.  My third mistake was believing the experience would be anything like the reviews or even on par with Universal Studios.  The entire area was flooded with people.  The entire  park is visually stunning, wrought with detail and immersive in stature.   Unfortunately it felt more like a museum without a tour guide though.  At the First Order side we saw a total of four storm troopers at a distance, two with Kylo Ren for about 60 seconds and two on a roof of a building...woopty doo.  At the Resistance side we saw Ray nicely dressed up but she kept moving with 5-10 kids in trail and no chance to get close for a picture let alone talk to her.  The shops are cool to puruse but, if you don't schedule the light saber or Droid build time well in advance you'll miss out like we did.  You can't use your Fastpass with the Millennium Falcon ride, or really any other ride if you don't get to the park within an hour or so of opening because all the Fastpass slots fill up so quickly...total waste of money.  The line for the Falcon ride is a large, boring parking lot for the Falcon that connects to a smaller, more boring ""storage space"" for cargo containers and then through a building that has some cool looking equipment and finally to a briefing room before the actual ride.  There was absolutely no entertainment outside of the actual building...only some employees in robes telling people not to cut in line.  For the 2+ hour wait there are no bathrooms nearby and only one small food stand with pop and popcorn that takes about 1.5 hours of waiting to get to...some fricking boring! I thought there would be more buttons to push, things to interact with and characters to talk to and was once again left wanting for more. The ride was unimpressive as you simply push a few flashing buttons and/or watch a nice animated tour with decent visuals and movement (hard to do both) at the same time.  There was clearly something missing in the storyline/effects related to an external hitchhiker or passenger that confused everyone...needs fixed, Disney.  The pilots either have left/right or up/down control and neither do much, along with the blinking lights to push and the hyperspace lever that must be pulled not pushed like in the movies.  Having my expectations to high was a downer and the kids weren't impressed.  We had much more fun at Universal Studios.",2/5,3 years ago on  Google

We drove all the way from Washington state and paid more to eat and to get into the stupid place than we paid for our hotel and the rest of our vacation COMBINED and we even had a 5-star hotel in Los Angeles near LAX. The crowd management is HORRIBLE! The fast pass is an absolute JOKE! The place is absolutely over-crowded. We were there two days and got to go on 4 rides total. Each ride had a minimum of 120 minute wait time. If you got the fast pass earlier in the day, like 11 AM for example, it would schedule you to come back between 8-11PM. THIS PARK SUCKS! Worst theme park experience ever! If you've never been there, it's nearly impossible to find the fast pass machines or the ingress to the rides, because it's so crowded and unorganized. Worst time ever. This horrible place ruined our vacation and ripped us off. We thought that if we were paying that much, we'd at least get to enjoy ourselves or maybe even get reasonably priced food or souvenirs. Wrong! Disneyland was the worst place EVER to vacation. If I could rate less than one star, I would.We went to worlds of fun in KC a year ago and it was absolutely amazing! I definitely recommend worlds of fun.

Zero stars for the greedy ridiculous tactics to put more money in the pockets of their filthy millionaire rich executives’ pockets. The new genie+ is so ridiculous. It’s extra money to get one ride faster for the whole day. Last time we were here 2 years ago the Fast Passes were amazing, I rode the same rides 2-3 times a day even with large crowds. This time the ticket prices were more, the genie+ was extra and the whole day I rode 7 rides, in 12 hours. Just wow. The park was way dirtier. The food was barely edible. And the worst part was paying over $100 a day just to have almost every ride break down. We waited for the incredicoaster, which broke down and we had to get kicked out. Then guardians of the galaxy broke down, so we had to wait twice as long (45 minutes in the lightning lane). Then the new spider man ride was out of commission half the day. Good grief, does ANYTHING work? Also I am so sick of the park being geared more and more towards grown up millennials with disposable income. Like, what are you thinking? I thought Walt wanted this place to be family friendly? Why are half the food stands for alcoholic beverages? Why are there only 3 rides I can take my 1 year old on? All these adults are now going, running past families with little kids, practically knocking us down to get ahead of us in the lines. The constant f words by your trashy attendees made it uncomfortable to be around with my 3 small children.

Noticeable issues with lighting. On Splash mountain, you could see some of the animitronics dancing in the pitch black due to zero lighting on parts of the ride. On Indiana Jones, you could barely make out the rolling Boulder at the end. On rise of the resistance, there were several things on the ride not working. Between webslingers, midway mania and haunted house, our cart was constantly stopping mid ride with screens and other features not working.I was there just 2 months ago and the 4 days I was there were flawless and experienced almost no issues, but this time, without exaggerating, 60% of the time my party and I used genie+ to get a lightning lane, we'd show up to the attraction and it'd be temporarily closed, forcing us to use the lightning lane pass on a different ride.I really hope this is all just temporary and that they get it figured out.",2/5,7 months ago on  Google

The chili cone carne the pretzel cone was stale and the macaroni cone the macaroni was made 1 to 2 hours before we were swrved it for 10 dollars. Stop by the Bengal barbecue where they will serve you literally 3 bites of the toughest meat you have ever tasted for 8 dollars. And you are like he's a chef maybe he takes big bites my 7 year old finished it in 3 long chewed bites because they don't cook the meat fresh for you it comes out of a warming tray. The grey grateau was so dry you knew it was prepped bare minimum yesterday. Turn it into a tres leches and now it becomes moist and stays moist for long holding periods. And that's just the food. Nobody ever really talked or acted in character. I had the lightning lane so I talked to an employee at every ride and it was literally like any other theme park. ""Lightning lane left"" mumbled by a teenager that could care less. ""Mobile orders. Mobile orders. Only mobile orders."" They demand. ""Sorry our mobile ordering system doesn't mean your food is gonna be there right then you still have to wait 20 minutes.

2363,"You could write a review a mile long about your Disney Experience because it’s such and encompassing park and you will inevitably have some ups and downs throughout the course of your visit. The most important thing to do as it relates to Disney is PLAN AHEAD. Have an idea of what you want to do, when you plan on eating, how much you want to spend, etc.And here is the ultimate Pro Tip: Use fast pass whenever possible! It will increase the amount of things you can do/ see in one day as you will waste far less time standing in lines.The park itself is massive, so make sure everyone is dressed comfortably and drinking LOTS of water! Also, if you have little ones give them clear instructions on what to do if they somehow get separated.

While I did find some things ridiculous, such as a room for a line cue to form as it lead to a ride, I realize now that they did this to keep customers out of the heat and to make the experience more enjoyable for others. Charging $3.99 for 20oz of Dasani may be my only complaint. Than again, in the aspect of business, this kind of markup helps with the leading cost of payroll and overhead. Disney spends lots of money to allow guest to enjoy their stay. At Park admission alone they may not make the needed minimum to continue the quality of the park.

2422,"I have been to disneylandmany times growing up. It was always so fun and magical. I have not been for about 10 years and really wanted to take my 9 year old for his first time. We went on a Tuesday thinking it wouldnt be as crowded. Firstly, there was a  25 min from the farthest parking structure we where made to park in that was 30 dollars. There wasn't a shuttle or anything to take you to the park. And to bad if you have go to the bathroom on what felt like a 2 mile hike, there isnt one.  And if you enjoy going to cosco on a Sunday and spend 8 hours walking around and waiting for at least an hour for everything you wanted to do, then this is the place for you. There were people everywhere. Lines started outside the lines of rides. I wasnt sure if there where people just walking through or waiting in lines for rides. It felt like one huge line at one point in the day. My son wanted to go home 1 hour into being there because we were just waiting in lines to have fun. The food was expensive, I expected that. But I did expect it to be good. It wasn't.  Disney spends a lot of money to make the park look nice and it does, but you can't enjoy it. Because they're are so many people you have to dodge that you can't enjoy looking around.  I have so much more complaining too do but I think you get the idea. I will never come back here again,  it wasn't fun,  we didn't get to ride very many rides because to do that you needed to pay more to get on rides you've already paid for faster. This place is a joke and disneyland should be ashamed of themselves for its a small world ride.  It's truely horrible,  and yes we did ride it because it had the shortest line. And now I know why. And one more thing. They need to work on the mixing of the sound coming out for the haunted mansion and indiana Jones ride. You couldn't understand a thing it was saying.

2461,"Our family purchased the Military Salute tickets prior to pandemic, which were given an expiration date of 12/16/21. We continually attempted to make reservations the last few weeks so we could upgrade our tickets to passes. Our family loves Disneyland. After being unable to secure reservations my husband contacted Disney through the chat feature on the app several days prior to the expiration date. On the last d!y we called several times and waited lengthy hold times. The last time we waited for 90 minutes and spoke with Dominique to upgrade. It was 900p, their closing time, so she said she was transferring us to a manager. We waited for 20 minutes for someone to answer and then disconnect after stating she couldn't hear us. We sent another chat, an email, attempted to call, and someone finally contacted us today. She gave us policy and stopped chat when we asked for her superior, as this goes beyond policy. After doing everything within policy, she advised we cant upgrade 5 tickets. If we tried after the date I'd understand, but we honored the policies set and thought Disneyland would do the same.

To (badly) paraphrase Walt Disney himself, this park simultaneously fills a kid with joy and imagination while taking an adult back to those wonderful childhood qualities. There's just something about the energy in the air and so many kinds of fun to have there. Trying to make your teacup go the fastest, catching the parades, cramming in as many rides as you can in that last half hour crunch before closing, going with a young son/daughter/niece/nephew and seeing the wonder about them (total soCal rite of passage btw), or as I used to do when I was younger, show up totally high and trip on everything.Yeah, everything is mad expensive and the lines are terrible most of the time.

2493,After the Pandemic you would think Disney would get it together and fix all the kinks out of its ride. Only to find out last minute several kids rides were closed as I was celebrating my daughter 1st birthday.  Not only have the prices of admission gone up but you gotta buy 2 days at the very least and set up reservations too if you want a weekend as one of the options. If you add Genie to your package you also get limited express rides cause there is a limit to how many times you can reserve the Lighting Lane.  All the food is much more expensive with smaller portions literally Shrinkflation at its best.  It’s really feels like they are just price gouging you from the get-go.  Many of the rides also got stuck half way through the ride only to have my sister in law fall off after being un-Boarded off a kids ride.  Over all the experience was horrible.  Plus even after you got Genie for the shortcuts you still gotta pay an additional $18 for each person on rides like Cars at Californias Adventure or wait 85mins.  I’ll probably now go until my 1year old is six.,2/5,9 months ago on  Google

2501,"Well, let's start.....The two stars are for the two workers who were pleasant and made our time with them better. Cam, and Lawrence    (1 star for each of them)  were very understanding and helpful when problems occurred, for example. Splash mountain, a ride know for being very fun, which it was , and I have no complaints to the ride itself, the crew working the splash mountain were rude, and unforgiving. The ride was stopped, and we got an announcement to exit the vehicle, once we did, we we're rudely yelled at for exiting the vehicle when we were clearly told to do so. Then, instead of compensation for the technical difficulties, we were escorted and told to not record or take our phones out . Again, Cam and Lawrence deserve a raise......Also the haunted Mansion ride was having difficultiesAlso the Indiana Jones ride was having difficultiesAlso the small world ride was having difficultiesThe Hungry Bear Cafe service was great, and the view was also amazing, a star for that restaurant as well, try the watermelon ice slushie.Although we did not get a picture of Lawrence, we took one of Cam, they both are amazing, no favoritism",3/5,4 years ago on  Google

We travelled to LA 3 weeks ago all the way from New Zealand and spent 3 days at Disneyland and California Adventure.  I am delighted to say that we had the best time ever! It was everything we had ever dreamed of and more.  We were visiting in the middle of Summer when it was very busy.  However because of things like, the Disney app, Fast Passes and Magic Morning (as well as some planning beforehand) we were able to ride all of the most popular rides as well as many other rides.  Believe it or not we really didn't spend a lot of time  queueing .  In fact our longest queues would have been 20mins.  Our daughter loved her make over at the Bibbidy Bobbidy Boutique and the little t-shirt and tutu are gorgeous. The food was good and there was lots to choose from. The merchandise available was amazing! (could have easily blown the budget but showed great restraint!The staff were helpful and friendly.  The toilet facilities were clean and tidy and there were lots of them.Thank you Disney for such an amazing time!  In fact, we loved it so much that we have decided to save again and come back next year!  There are a couple of things we would do differently this time around, we missed out on getting a good spot to watch the night parade from, so that was a little disappointing as we missed most of it.  We also didn't get as many pictures with Disney characters as we would have liked and unfortunately no Disney Princesses at all, because those queues were long and often had been closed-off by the time we arrived.  So we will definitely try and make up for that next time!Once again thank you Disneyland, we can't wait to come back!",5/5,5 years ago on  Google

I was planning on going on a Monday, but the only day available was the Saturday before. So I booked for that day, then did a little more looking, if you purchase the key (which is the same price as a normal ticket you could pretty much go any day of the week, when I asked if I could upgrade to a key I was told I would have to go to the park to do that and set a whole new reservation, but I still wouldn’t be guaranteed entry on the day that I wanted. So I decided to keep my ticket, then asked since I paid for a high traffic day, but was waiting for a lower priced day would I be reimbursed for the difference and was told no, but that if I purchased a weekday ticket and wanted to change my reservation to a weekend I’d have to pay the difference?

2597,"Disneyland will always have a place in my heart but my recent visit felt quite different. The system to reserve the parks was confusing but understandable untill we entered the park and we could tell it was overpacked regardless. Also if you get the park hopper, they won't let you into another park till 1pm. The lightning pass was worth it for my boyfriend and I as it worked for the rides we wanted and the times worked out, but it was also a bit confusing to use.Mind you, the lightning pass on its own doesn't work for the new starwars ride: Rise of the Resistance, you need to pay extra I believe 20 dollars on top of the lightening pass. So it you are planning on going on the ride have your budget set up!The park still feels magical in the sense of looking at its presence and aesthetic. The stores still carry adorable merch! The corn dogs are still super delicious (order ahead in the app if you are getting chips and a drink with it, its so much faster than waiting in the line).Overall, it was still a fun day for us but we also noticed how unhappy and tired some of the employees were, and felt bad and wondered if they are being overworked.",4/5,9 months ago on  Google

2610,"Had a GREAT time at Disneyland this week! The experience reminded me of days gone by, when the park was easy to navigate and the lines were small. There's a new parking structure under construction, so you may wish to allow 45 mins or so to get to the main entrance.Getting there early was a big plus, and with the prices as high as they are, worth the effort.Planning is important. If you want to eat at a certain restaurant, reserve your table asap, and be flexible if your preferred time isn't available. You'll have a better chance of getting a table during the parades, or other park-wide event.Start in Adventureland, and swing  around the park from there; most folks go to Tomorrowland first. Go figure :)Give yourself, and your group, breaks throughout the day. A cool ride, on the steam engine train around the park, is enjoyable, and a delight to your feet!Lots to do in addition to rides! There's New Orleans Square with it's perfumerie and fine, etched glass store, strolling down main street, the Pendelton store in Fronterland, to name a few, and Pixey Hollow, where you can see Tinkerbell, and other Disney characters. In fact, one of the best parts of the day, was seeing A LOT of the characters around the park. It was delightful to see them interacting with everyone!...And that brings me to the best part of Disneyland: the ""cast members."" True to Disney tradition and protocol, you won't find kinder and more pleasant people anywhere. They work very hard, but always seem to have a smile and a helping hand to offer.I could go on and on, but it's DISNEYLAND!

2615,I've been coming to this Disney Land since I was a wee lad. But I have also been to Disney Paris and Disney Tokyo and ever since I realized Anaheim's version just doesn't have the magic that the other parks have. First of all the place is dirty and it has a strange smell. Secondly the castle is tiny compared to the other parks. And finally the rides look a little run down and faded. Idk if it's because this park is older but in my option Tokyo's got them beat by a long shot.

I wish I could say that we had a an experience like this but that would be far from the truth. My friends and I had our skateboards with us because we had just came from a skate park. We thought we had placed them in a secure location no one would be able to find to prevent them from getting stolen. As we walked into the park we were getting our bags checked and the security was giving us these suspicious looks and kept eyeing us. A few moments later he started talking on his walkie talkie and looked at us and smirked. He told us to go with him and other staff members met with us and him. Some how they had our skateboards and were questioning us on why we had them. We discussed with them what we had the skateboards cause we had just came from the skate park but they did not believe us. They ended up keeping me and my friends skateboards. This is unacceptable behavior for them. This is no way to treat one of their paying customers. They stole our money, time, and stuff.

It always takes way longer than you think to navigate to parking and then make your way on the tram to the park. If you can, take the carpool lanes! They'll get you right to the park!If meeting someone to share you day with, pick a specific spot in Downtown Disney. Since many stores will have multiple entrances, specify which door.

I enjoyed the park in the earlier years, but after this experience I’m not sure I want to come back. The wait times for everything have gone up an insane amount since you now have to pay even more money for the fast passes that cannot even be used how they used to be. Kind of ruined the experience for me and my whole family cause why would we want to spend even more money at a multi billion dollar company after spending so much already? It’s ridiculous! We have been season pass holders for years and it’s still not worth it to me or my family. I hope one day they can go back to the old ways cause that would fix multiple problems including the longer wait times because if there is a big stand by like of people and a big lightning lane of people they will send 1 group of people from stand by and then fill the rest with lightning lane holders and it seems to make wait times a lot longer.

I'm not sure if Covid, subpar pay/working conditions or what were the culprit but there were no princesses or characters out and about besides Chewbacca.  It was festive but not transcendent: literally just a crowded theme park with a Disney/Star Wars veneer.  She likes the Dumbo stuffie we got her but she talks about the plane ride to and from CA more than her trip to Disney.  Yeah, I'm being harsh but c'mon: it's Disneyland.  It's supposed to be the best.If you're a Star Wars fan, that area is impressive and immersive and seemingly aimed at nostalgic adults.  I always remembered Disney being focused on, well... Disney and the kids that are into it.  Had I known this is the direction the park's focus had gone I would have forgone the premium ticket price and and taken her somewhere else.Go there if you're a Star Wars loving adult or have grade school kids clamoring to go there.  Avoid if you are expecting the Disney experience tailored to young children who are growing up with the cartoons and movies.  It won't be worth the price and hassle until they're olderMaybe we'll revisit in a few years but I'm in no hurry; especially since she more or less shrugged the visit off and hasn't given it a second thought.",2/5,9 months ago on  Google

2852,"The review below stands, but my final memories of these parks are now the zealous kids running the rides announcing on the PA literally dozens of times to wear your mask over your nose when some random person didn't...ONE day before the rule expires in CA.  I don't want to pay the bills of those people anymore.  You are welcome to.A SoCal resident weekday 3 day pass is now $199, no option for more days. You can reserve your starting park most weekdays through early May currently, they don’t have to be within a two week period.  You can change reservation dates later.  You can add a park hopper option after 1 PM for $60 for all three days, you can’t buy it for fewer days.  If you buy Genie+ when you buy the ticket ($20/day) you have to buy it for all three days.It will be somewhat busy every day.  You certainly should do the free Genie in the Disneyland app before you arrive, which allows sit-down dining reservations (penalty for no-shows not cancelled).  Once in a park, you can buy a “Individual Lightning Lane (ILL) ” for 1 or 2 (not 3) of Rise Of The Resistance ($20), WEB Slingers ($15), or Radiator Springs Racers ($15).  You don’t need Genie+ to do this.  These three rides otherwise have a (long) standby line generally, but may have a virtual queue.  We wound up waiting 100 minutes for ROTR to save $40…it was showing a 65 minute wait but an announcement changed it to 105 when we had waited 10 minutes.Once inside a park you can also buy Genie+ for $20.  You get free pictures from Disney photographers and the few available ride photos, and access to Lightning Lane reservations to mostly skip the line for many non-ILL attractions once per day.  If you buy it ride the attractions not on the Lightning Lane list that you care about first (if you’re there early...Fantasyland dark rides and Jungle Cruise notably).On our Monday, January 11 visit Genie+ let us do everything we wanted in both parks on a 9A-9P schedule.  Bring a portable phone charger.  Mobile ordering food saved significant time.  When your Lightning Lane reservation ride is down long enough you get a Multiple Experience Pass, good until you use it that day, which notably included rides not on the Lightning Lane list (approach cast member at ride entrance or exit to clarify if you see the ride on the list the app is showing you).We were happy with the day.  Between the park hopper and the Genie+ the ticket was $107 for the day per person excluding $30 parking.  But aside from ROTR and Peter Pan we waited in very little line, did around 20 rides (everything we wanted) and had decent fast casual food with no wait with the mobile app.Masks were required (and often insisted upon) indoors. There’s a lot to get used to.  But it’s manageable.  And given the demand, that’s saying something.",3/5,10 months ago on  Google
2853,"Disneyland and every disney park for that matter are all exceptional works to be in. Everything is built with such an eye for precision and hidden details you wouldnt notice until your third or fourth time through scattered across every single attraction. There isn't a place to small or too big for the imagineers who built it to breath life into. Every themed land is built with a level of immersion so fantastical, if an ordinary person were to see it with no context to Disneyland, they might believe it to be genuine. Each area so diverse and different, from wild west and jungle adventure to star wars and marvel, no theme park even comes close to the immersion of disney.On both a technical and entertainment level, the rides and attractions are all beautifully built. The original rides from the 50's have clever parts, and the modern attractions almost always have architecture and design that could be argued as genius.The art is immaculate, but the artist is a different story.Disney charges prices where it's so blatently obvious they're nothing but a greedy corporate enterprise, it's astounding. The cheapest most cost effective tickets cost $104. Those are the tickets that keep you locked in one park, locks you in the slow lines, and doesnt cover parking, food, or any merchandise. If you want what moat consider to be a fun and worthwhile time at Disneyland, you have to pay even more fees. On top of the ticket that just lets you go into the park, theres a $20 fee per person for a very limited pass to fast lines on rides. Want to switch between the parks? Thats an almost $100 extra fee. Disney holds a monopoly on millions of childhoods and wont stop benefiting until they've squeezed every single last dollar from your pocket. The cast members are severly underpaid for the work they do, and a trip to Disneyland ends up being so pricey, there are people who live across the street from Disney who can't afford the trip. If you want to spend 1000 dollars to stand in long if not beautifully designed lines next to 50,000 other tourists for 12 hours than Disney is the place for you. But the modern landscape of disney squeezing every last cent out of consumers pockets is so disqusting. 2/5",2/5,11 months ago on  Google

2856,"This review goes for Rhonda at the guest relations/ticket booth right in front of the Disney and DCA entrance. We spent Saturday and Sunday at both disneyland theme parks and Sunday we wanted to check on the status of a refund before heading into DCA. We arrived at the guest relations window around 1:30 pm Sunday February 13 2022. We only wanted to inquire about the status of our refund for some tickets that had already been approved over the phone. Since the refund was taking longer than anticipated we decided to quickly check the status.We came up to the window and Rhonda asked us what we wanted and we explained the situation. From the moment we arrived you can tell she didn’t want to be at work. Her eyes glazed over when we explained the simple situation and why we are waiting for a refund. When we explained, she said “nah they wouldn’t have done that.” Keep in mind this refund had already been approved. So I don’t understand why she was trying to tell us they wouldn’t have done if it was already approved. This goes to show that instead of looking up our information she wanted to argue with us about what she thought she knew. She didn’t seem to understand our problem so my fiancé broke it down for her and said “look so we came to the park yesterday right? and what we are trying to do is…” she quickly followed up with a full blown attitude saying “I don’t know, did you?!”  This clearly wasn’t a question on his part. This was completely disrespectful and unnecessary.Since she couldn’t understand the simple problem she called another cast member to look us up. This other cast member immediately understood the situation and checked the computer then graciously told us the status of our refund. If Rhonda couldn’t comprehend a simple situation she could have kindly referred us to somebody else without the unneeded attitude or the huffing and puffing. I really hope Disney can do better and choose employees who actually want to be at work and who align with their core values as a company. This service sticks out like a sore thumb at a park like Disneyland and is completely unacceptable. I   honestly thought I was at six flags amusement park for a moment.. and that’s insulting to six flags. It completely ruined the mood for the first couple hours at the park.

I asked Rome to show me where it says thay, and Rome told me that it's my reponsibility to look it up on their website. I told him that I read all the rules before coming to the park, and pulled up the rule on my phone and asked him to show me where it says that. Rome said it must say somewhere else, and checked with his supervisor and said I can bring it in. He then said ""Get out of here"" as he was challenged, being very nasty and loud in my face, saying things like ""you wanna keep wasting time here?"" and refused to let me speak to his supervisor. I asked another security guy and he was able to have supervisor Steph come out to speak with me. She apologized, and offered us a free ride which was useless to us.

Because of this inconsistency, and as my queue time approached, I didn't want to risk getting in lines for other attractions lest they decide to call my queue number while waiting in lineAlso, some food can now only be ordered though the app.  If you want a beignet or mint julep, you better plan ahead and make sure the time given to pickup your food doesn't coincide with one of your virtual queue timesI understand Disney is moving along with current trends, but the app really takes away from that Disney magic.",2/5,8 months ago on  Google

We packed snacks. Parents only 1 Starbucks when u get in the park inside the cafe, so get your coffee walking in! 😉 The parade was magical, we chose to do 1 day since we planned other things in Cali. We came back 2 nights later and walked the Disney downtown district which is free and shopped and enjoyed our Starbucks which is a big beautiful one!

Today, the one day single park peak days ticket costs $149 for people 10 years and older!!! That is so sad for families who may need a little Disney magic, but are not well off. The food is typically priced for amusement park food but Disney has better quality. You can bring it backpacks and your own snacks of on a budget. I would also recommend purchasing the $15 max pass.

The ticket sales person didn't adequately explain the fast pass.  Only certain attractions have this option. You can only use it once every two hours.  Yes it is included with your ticket price, but to activate it you have to go to the attraction to scan the ticket to get a reserved  time slot.  The advantage of paying $15/ticket for this option is you can reserve via your app without having to maneuver through the crowds.  If we understood this we would have paid the extra $.  The app also lets you order food to go another time saver.  Tip, around parade times wait times drop for some attractions, but road crossings are limited and can delay your ability to get where you want to go.   Tip 2 you can bring your own food and drinks in plastic.  We really enjoyed our visit.😁",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

I think I had more fun than my 16 month old. We enjoyed seeing all of the characters that we grew up with, and while the line to see Mickey was quite long, we waited patiently and when we finally saw him, it was quite wonderful, especially for my son. The parade & the fireworks were just all so incredible.One thing I would suggest is, prior to the fireworks there should be an announcement over the loudspeaker, just so everyone can pick a spot. And maybe there was, and we just didn't pay attention. But I recall hearing the fireworks and then scrambling to find a spot, only to go around in circles, since there was no room left.

So many rides are so popular that they need a fast pass so you don't spend your day waiting in line. Have a plan, go to the busiest ride first thing and then work your way around the park. Same the food and look at everything you can. Our absolute favorite experience was Star Wars Galaxy Edge and wow was it absolutely fun and exhilarating! We also really enjoyed Indiana Jones and the Pirates of the Caribbean. The castle was absolutely beautiful for Christmas at night and Main Street was even more beautiful. There was a parade for Christmas down main Street and the ""It's a small world"" was so intricately decorated and animated for Christmas. There aren't enough words to describe the experience. We want to go back again to see it all again and experience what we didn't get to do the one (and busiest day they've had - so busy they closed the park for a short period of time).

It would be awesome to send out random coupons to people that want to sign up for stuff. For non-local residents who only visit. There are season pass deals easily available for locals, but for people that have to fly/drive in don't really have the ability to be a season pass holder unless their filthy rich.

3295,"Happiest Place on EarthWe went to the original Disneyland park and was able to fully experience the “magic” in a day.Tips to going to Disney would definitely be planning a timeline and attractions that are a “must see” for your family. When doing this, we were ahead of schedule and were able to use the max pass on the app twice. The longest wait time was for the new Star Wars attraction, with probably an hour wait. All our other “must see” rides were around 30 minutes wait. We went on a weekday, so the crowds were heavy but not completely packed.Negatives would be Disney charging twice for the online tickets when an “error message” popped up with the original purchase. It is outrageously expensive with a bottled water at $5 (but is expected). Lastly, due to being in the middle of October, a large pumpkin structure was built that was placed in the beginning of the park. With any other monuments/attractions (for example the castle or Walt Disney), your family goes up and takes photos, etc. However, when we went up to take a photo, a Disney member rudely tells us we need to go to the end of a huge line in the middle of the sidewalk in order for us to take a photo (that we were doing ourselves). Unfortunately, this was at the end of our day which was filled with great experiences. This member definitely put a negative ending to a happy day.",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

It was fun to see that many people were dressed in costume as they walked through the streets. The bobsled ride was closed for repairs or something so I didn't get to go on that one. Disneyland requires a lot of walking. That was the only downside but there's really nothing that can be done about that. All the ""cast members "" were friendly and wished me happy birthday because I had a special pin on. Some restaurants give special birthday treats like a cupcake with a candle.

It's an expensive trip so budget (if needed) to make those Disney dreams come true.Make a plan for the park of your ""must see/must do"" experiences. You will want to plan for multiple days.

Even when we were parked and waiting for shuttles we couldn't make any. Also when I get the cards for fast pass u can only get 1 then also. I think it would have been better to get one per ride a day per person than limit to 1 at a time. I didn't know that was the case either and grabbed one for later in the day and had to wait 4 hours before I could get more.

3514,"Over crowded.  Sorry, severely over crowded*.  Be very aware, that if you expect to come in before fireworks and are trying to get towards the back of the park, you are in for an unpleasant surprise.  There is one-way foot traffic at times, meaning you might just want to get somewhere nearby, but instead will be forced to navigate a congested maze of people sitting along the sidewalk, people standing on the sidewalk and cast members directing you to go ""all the way around.Even when there isn't a parade or fireworks, you can expect the majority of people to bump into you.  People seem to lose any situational awareness once they enter Disneyland.  I can have someone walking towards me, talking to the person next to them or staring off into the distance, and expect me to move out of the way. They have room to their right, I have no room on my right.  So I just stop and brace myself for impact--Doesn't hurt me, but are people that ignorant to their surroundings in general?Do yourself a favor and learn the park.  I went with a group of people and ended up standing around waiting for members of my group between rides because they went a different way.  Also, if you are staying at the hotels to the west, or parking from that direction, don't forget to utilize the monorail and beat the foot traffic in Disney Town, which is just as bad as walking in Disney.  Also, pay attention to when parades and fireworks start and avoid travel during that time-Not worth it.",3/5,3 years ago on  Google

We didn't ride everything, or see everything, but it was definitely a great time. Downside, there were quite a few rides out of commission. Food actually wasn't that badly priced.. I mean it wasn't cheap, but for the price of the tickets, I was expecting worse.

3531,"Disappointed.  There are some things at the park and park experiences that you could argue cannot be changed but I'll share anyway. We came to Disneyland with our two kids, 5 and 2, the week before spring break in hopes of crowd relief, but it was madness. We were advised to get to the park before it opened to enjoy the park before the flood of people but ended up spending 30 minutes (arriving at 8am) in a mosh pit with no direction at all, with the exception of one person yelling at everyone to stay to the left or right and to keep the center clear ... In this setting, the park can take measures to maybe have some sort of entertainers that both keep you smiling and keep the order just to get through the initial opening... I hoped for a magical experience and hoped for characters and staff to make that happen, but it didn't. Even after squeezing through the entrance and getting inside there was sea of people and absolutely no direction and limited staff around to assist. We approached two lines at separate time for a meet and greet just to be turned away with  what essentially felt like a ""sorry, the line is closed now, you can meet the character later elsewhere."" I get it, we were late, but one of these lines we were the only ones that got there a minute late before the cut off with no one else behind us... it just felt like staff have their orders and are not empowered to help guests have a unique or special moment, infact, staff seemed more focused on  herding people forward then offering any ""magical"" type of experience. Disneyland is designed for moving people through the rides and into the shops on the other end and have unfortunately lost their initial goal and vision of creating a special magical experience which includes staff that deliver that experience. I feel that Disneyland is failing their employees and their guests and I hope someone who can make a change begins making it soon otherwise I don't see a reason to return to what essentially is another average theme park....alsosmelled like rotten eggs inside the park which was odd.",2/5,10 months ago on  Google
3532,"Our family had a blast being able to go to Disneyland the week before Christmas! There was always something to do. The fast pass is definitely worth buying each day as you can be standing in line for one ride, while waiting for your specific time to go to the next ride. If you use the app, it works even better. The new Star Wars ride didn't have the option for the fast pass, probably because it's newer, but I didn't want to wait in line for an hour or more. The kids wouldn't have lasted that long. It was fun to explore the Star Wars area though and interact with the storm troopers and see the Millennium Falcon. We spent 4 days there and had fun every time, even with it being so busy.

There are so many things to do here! You don't have to ride the rides to have fun. People watching is one of my favorites. There are tours (additional cost). Walking in Walt's footsteps takes you through the history of Disneyland, and you get to go into his apartment. My favorite tour is the Christmas tour.There are a variety of rides and food. Many places need reservations. You can get reservations in advance on the app. The app wait time for rides is one of the best features to plan your time.I've been coming to Disneyland since the early 80s, and I've seen it change.

And then another 40 just to buy the tickets. There was a 70 minute wait in each  attraction  yes 70 minutes!!!  And I don’t need to tell you how it is to stand in line for 70 minutes each time with little kids. We stood in line for two rides but had enough of just spending the day standing in another line. Left after only a couple of hours. We spent over $1500 on tickets alone not to mention the money we spent on food and drinks waiting in line.

The food is plain and don't look apealling.Overall it was a nice experience. We left to eat somewhere else and came back.,4/5,4 years ago on  Google
3696,"Love going to Disney!!! There are a few tips,1. Go as early as possible in the day because lines are REALLY long all year round. (I would know I’ve gone several times throughout the year over the past few years)2. Take some food /drinks if your under a budget...it’s expensive inside!3. Ask about if anything is closed down for maintenance BEFORE you buy your tickets because they are non-refundable. I’ve gone before were they were renovating the big iconic castle and it was such a bummer because that is the best place to get that iconic Disneyland photo!4. HYDRATE!!! Can’t stress this enough! You will walk a lot! It doesn’t seem a lot but check your steps or distance walked at the end of the day...try to stay hydrated!5. HAVE FUN!! It’s great for adults and for kids!! I went with my husband on our way back from our honeymoon and spent a day there it was nice to go without kids and act like kids at a park. :)",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

3703,"While the Disney World park in Orlando has more of a ""resort"" feel to it, the original Disneyland park as of 1955 is absolutely gorgeous in every way on it's own. The crowds can be a bit much here, but they are having a good time! The entire time I was here I felt as if I were in a fantasy.The rides were a blast. Space mountain I went on for the first time, and trust me, it was a life changer. On jungle cruise, my tour guide was extremely funny; and on the Indiana Jones ride, I truly felt like I was part of one of my favorite movie trilogies. The rides seem as if they are gingerly taken care of each day by wonderful staff.The food was flawless. Dined at the Blue Bayou (We had to make a reservation), and found no problems! The gumbo was almost addicting!There are thousands of chairs scattered around the park, so even if you just want to relax in the happiest place on Earth, you will have the convenience!Unfortunately, the crowds can be one's undoing. When we had to go to the bathroom, we had to wait in a long, but fast moving line.

We got a Fast Pass for one we wanted to go on and then waited in line for Roger Rabbit.  The kids were pumped but really getting tired in the line after about 40 minutes. We finally got to the front and the ride broke down. No passes were given to come back and we couldn't get another Fast Pass yet. Disappointed with that we made our way over to the Jungle Cruise only to have the exact same thing happen. What a waste of time! We had lunch at the expensive  New Orleans restaurant and it was not very good, most of the food was left on our plates. I normally love Disneyland and so do the kids but not sure if any of us are interested in going back. On a side note, I am disabled and standing for any length of time is very difficult.

On top of that, many rides were breaking down after having waited in line for an hour. I just don't think going to Disneyland is worth it considering the cost and the amount of time you spend waiting. You have to go for 3-4 days just to experience everything but most of that time is spent waiting. Fast passes makes it easier but scheduling all of that means you can't just roam the park. It doesn't feel like a vacation. The Millennium Falcon – Smugglers Run was a lot of fun and they made the wait part of the experience.

We spent $350 in total (for two adults and one ""free"" 2-year-old).  That means we spent an average of $50 per activity.  Imagine paying $50 and standing in line for 35 minutes for a 5-minute carousel ride!Not that we were doing amazing activities or anything.  We chose most of our activities based on the fact that they advertised shorter wait times.  For example, we took the train around Disneyland because they advertised a 10 minute wait time, but unfortunately the actual wait was 30 minutes.I estimate that we spent more that 4 hours waiting on long lines, and maybe 1.5 hours actually enjoying attractions.Kids hate long waits, so Disneyland is more child abuse than amusement park.

3787,Came during Christmas time and obviously Disneyland is great and magical  especially for photos. The decorations were really festive and the castle looked amazing. We got the fastpass this time but you have to schedule the rides at a time which really got annoying since sometimes it wouldn't give you the option to select the ride you wanted.

It wasn't till it was closer to the weekend where more of the characters came out. Plus some rides exit you straight into the gift shop. My kids had a blast and were patient in the relatively short lines. They moved pretty quickly. I did not like the concept of the fast pass, basically paying to not stand in line. I did like the photo pass part. It was a great experience for my family though.",4/5,4 years ago on  Google

Yes, you do get on the rides quicker, and your not running around looking for a fast pass machines. I don't think this is fair to the visitors, especially for first timers, who know nothing about Disneyland, and how it all works.

The food and merchandise is expensive, but you can bring your lunch! My family and I pack snacks and lunch, if we want to save some money. I definitely reccomend to make the most of your time, to take advantage of the fast pass at the attractions, which is free. However, and it is worth it, there is a max pass you can purchase on your phone and you get fast passes on your phone and not have to walk to the attractions. My family and I got the max pass this year added on to our annual passes. We are always pressed on time and days, we have the second cheapest pass. This max pass system allows us to make the most of our visits! Disneyland decorates beautifully for each season. Love it. My husband and I love Disneyland and it is worth the money to visit!

Running into other people and being ran over with strollers and such isn't fun.  I wish there was a smaller capacity limit just so it would make it more enjoyable but no matter what I will always go back.

They let way too many ppl in the park and you are lucky to get in 3 rides in a day because most of the time the rides will close after you've waited for 1+hrs as you nearing the entrance of the ride. 80k visitors * $125 = $10M just from ticket sales.

From the minute you step inside you feel like you are transported into a Disney movie. From the castle to the jungle and to space you feel like you are taking part in a movie.

The price hike for single day and annual passes hasn't really shown much progress in keeping attendance lower.My suggestion, go during the week, and keep away on the weekends whenever possible.

3935,Visited the Disneyland theme park with my 3 year old and had a blast for a whole day. Parking is at Mickey and Friends parking lot ($20). From there a tram takes you to the park entrance from where you can go to the Disneyland Theme park or the California Adventure Park. A few tips for people planning to spend only a day or 2 with young kids. Make sure you plan your day in advance and figure out which rides and shows do you want to see. It's virtually impossible to cover everything in a day or even a couple of days. Make sure you understand and use the concept of fast passes to bypass long lines on a few of the attractions. Don't miss the parades which happen a couple of times a day. There are height restrictions in few of the attractions which might limit your choice of things you want to do with your kid. Enjoy the fireworks towards the end of the day and make sure you get some warm clothes as it gets pretty cold (we were there on the 1st of Jan). Be prepared to wait in long lines (specially during peak times) and it wouldn't be a bad idea to get something to do while standing. Overall it was a fantastic day spent for me and my family.,5/5,3 years ago on  Google

The staff is professional when in character and out. I don’t remember any of them walking around the grounds staring at their cells like so many workers these days.  They appear focused on the customer.  For fun family you’ll enjoy assuming you can afford it.,5/5,3 years ago on  Google
3968,"Fun place, allowed to bring snacks and beverages in the park. The biggest downside is transportation. The teams are always packed and have to wiggle your way for about 30 mins to an hour just to get on. Having a stroller makes this process a lot more difficult. The parking lot only has 1 working elevator and it is small. The wait for the elevator is another 30 min wait. Not friendly for strollers and is such a house.

I'm 13 at the moment and still think it's amazing and super fun. Hotels are also super comfortable, nice pools, and service. There are obviously other hotels in the area, but you have to park or walk a long distance on select hotels to get to Disneyland.Well, that's my review!

My family typically plans out our trip and fast pass schedule but with the creation of max pass (through the Disneyland app) that is no longer needed! Seriously, the Disneyland app is the greatest thing that has happened to the park since I can recall. Like always, the park was extremely clean and all of the staff was friendly. The quality of the shops and food is well above the typical theme park. I highly recommend checking out a Disneyland crowd forecasting calendar when planning your vacation. If you can avoid high traffic days, do it. One major bummer was Pirates of the Caribbean was under maintenance. If you have your heart set on a specific ride don't hesitate to call and ask if it will be available. Obviously it is not guaranteed, but there is no harm in checking maintenance windows.

Instead of enjoying the park, we were constantly looking to see if we had a chance with our 112 boarding number. Our children were stressed the whole day and in the end ( late at night) our number got cut off so we never road the ride....we left with crying children....it defeats the purpose of the happiest place on earth! Figure out another way, I feel it's a gimmick to get your guest to show up super early and stay super late at your park in the hope's of riding this ride.

If you have kids I'm sure the experience for the wee ones is magical and all that fun stuff, but if you're an adult without a very disposable amount of money to spend, the experience is not great and is incredibly draining. Walking around all day and then driving back to a hotel is exhausting. The rides are much more child friendly than adult oriented. The food is massively overpriced, and it's really annoying to wait in line. There's also no where to escape the noise and crowds. I sat in a bathroom stall several times building up the mental fortitude to face the sheer crush of people that surrounded me for 3 days. If you do end up going I recommend staying in one of the resort hotels and make sure you set aside a very liberal food budget.

4056,150 dollars + 25 to park.  Get in to find that most ride have a 2 hour or longer wait.  At the price they charge they could add a few more attractions which would cut down wait times.

I don’t know how people can stand in line for 2 hours for a 3 minute ride and smile the whole time; I cannot.  It is not the happiest place on earth, just the most expensive.  The nickel and diming is overwhelming - 20 dollars for this add on, 10 dollars for that.  Not enough bathrooms and they not clearly labeled.  Not enough shade during the hot days while in line, and not enough light at night to see.  Feel like cattle being herded sometimes.In summary, I just cannot justify the upside when you consider the downside.  How can people call this the happiest place on earth if they’re really being honest with themselves?  It’s beyond me but maybe I’m an a-hole too.

4096,Was hoping to enjoy this experience with my 6 kids and unfortunately I paid to walk around. The lines to get tickets were long then to have the windows be shut down to one. Then the line to check bags was ridiculously long Wait time as well. Wait times for rides are ridiculous and with kids needing to pee often that didn't help. This was our first trip ever and I got kids that wanted to leave and just go somewhere else and that was heartbreaking. I tried to make it fun by getting pictures with characters and as soon as a line started 5 pictures were taken and then they left. It made me the bad mom because I made them leave the line. Then tried to eat places and nothing is equipped to accommodate the ridiculous amount of people that go there on a daily basis! Max pass had time frames then rides are shut down for maintenance. It was very disappointing to have driven from Washington to see that my kids expected to be at the happiest place on earth and instead see the amount of rude people here and stand in a line to be told the ride is shut down.

The castle at night didn't disappoint and the fire works where great! Crowd's at times during this time of year do get crazy! And can be hard to get through but only in some areas do they get that bad. Rides where great for all ages and the overall details of the Park are hands down awesome. Now the reason for 4 stars is due to the fact that we purchased max passes for 10 people but where only able to use it twice because not even half way through the day all passes where full. So all that money went down the drain. Plan plan plan I can't say that enough. Plan out what rides and when and you'll be able to get more rides in and see more of the Park.

4158,"If you want to have an enjoyable experience, take my advice.Go early in the morning, as soon as the park opens, go on the most popular attractions first, and get a fast pass for another popular attraction while you wait in line for another attraction. If a ride shutdowns suddenly, keep up to date on it as it will usually start up again in 30 minutes, and there will be less people waiting in line for it.While food is expensive, there are ways to save money. Look for places that serve large portions, as almost every food selection is the same price for a meal.",4/5,4 years ago on  Google
4159,"By now you probably know it's over priced. Too big to see half of everything in one day, mainly due too the long queues you have to wait in. And going for more than one day makes it unaffordable got most with a family with children. Why children under 94"" has to pay almost same as adults and not allowed in 80% of the rides also don't make sense.The people that dished out the extra money for faster queue times gets inserted in front of everyone to the point where we had to wait over an hour to ride on the snowy mountain. Luckily it is a bad ride and we didn't have to do that again. But if you make the maths, my family spent $1K for a day ticket which basically gives you just over 10 hours which made this one ride wait costing us $100. Bad deal.On the good side the staff is really friendly, the grounds beautiful and some of the rides really nice, but you will queue for 35 plus minutes. I liked the new Star Wars area just sad there was not enough time to go into all the little shops and places.Tip: if you go, wait untill ALL your children is over 7 years or at least 104"" else it will ruen it for the whole family as you would need to split up and do stupid little boring rides with the smaller ones and make turns.

We walked onto most of the rides with little if any waiting,  we go there at 8:30 and had finished with most of the rides by about 12. Fantasmic light show was amazing.

Would definitely recommend the Max Pass if you wanna skip the line-ups, only $10 per person per day. Didn't see any characters other than the parades, which is quite disappointing.

4165,"My family and I have been visiting Disneyland consistently for the last 12 years either as annual pass holders or with multi day tickets.We truly enjoy the rides, particularly now that our grandkids are old enough to really engage with it all. The downside to Disney remains the cost, crowding and the excessive marketing of every aspect of the experience.It is these factors that have overwhelmed us, particularly the cost and crowds, forcing us to curtail our time spent at the parks.I don't know how Disney can solve the problem since it is a corporate behemoth driven by the shareholder's bottom line interests. So, price and crowd control are not options. It remains the visitor's responsibility to control the visit. From timing to purchases in the park, it is your responsibility to manage it all. In our case, we were fortunate to pick days of the week and time of year for the visit that gave us one of the most enjoyable experiences in the park in years. We can do that because we live relatively close, and we have a deep familiarity with them rhythms of the parks, which most occasional visitors or one time visitors don't.More than anything, I hope my notes here are helpful as a guide to what to expect instead of a review. Disney is fun in the right context and timing, but it is up to you to find the right ones for you. Don't expect the magic to happen because of Disney, you have to make your own magic with the right choices.",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

I spent most of my time dodging entitled parents who have very little courtesy towards fellow walkers.Even after doing research to avoid large crowds,  the place was jammed packed and several prime attractions were closed during magical morning. If you like standing in line,  this is the place for you! Made our experience miserable.Found the park rather dirty and run down in certain places.

It's not all bad--the scenery and landscape design looks nice, and some of the rides are pretty enjoyable (like the Incredibles roller coaster and the Indiana Jones ride).

That being said it was an enjoyable experience.  The vibe of Disneyland has definitely evolved over the years.  It's nice to see all the new things that they're constantly adding.  I would say maybe add a few more benches and places for people to sit.  There were so many people that some of them were just sitting on the ground due to a lack of seating.

4191,"Updated- original review below- So this is a Dney California adventure review Disney! They both were packed to the hilt. Lines everywhere. Reservations booked for restaurants and the park all over a month in advance. Be advised you need a "" reservation"" as well as a park hopper. There are ALOT of people! Instead of focusing on the congestion we just focused on getting from one place to the next. There were plenty of gluten free options for food. We stayed at the GC, so We had a great picnic on the wharf at CA one day of our adventure. By staying at a Disney hotel, we worked some "" magic"" with some cast members for a bday, and all and all it was a really great time.One day we did more the 20 rides!  It's alot of work, and if you have anxiety due to covid, I would not go. But if you can focus on having fun with the family, and you are fortunate to stay at a hotel on the property , you can get on a couple of good rides early at 8am, before the lines start. Hint- by whatever genie extras they offer to save time. 3 rides at the parks require payment to bypass the lines. Radiator springs- Rise of the Empire, and Spiderman. I would buy thise passes before they sellout or risk waiting 1.5 hours per ride. Reservations sell out early It's a pay to win place! But that's ok if you don't go every day of the year. Go to Kohls or Target for Disney gear or spend 400 percent more! They have many licensed Disney products for less. 12 dollars for 40 dollars mickey ears. 11 dollars for good shirts. If not there was ALOT of merchandise in thr dney stores to please. And, If you know you are going a couple months in advance, learn the Mobile  Disneyland genie application well, to maximize your stay! Also- make sure you make dinner reservations in the app, as fast as possible or you will not eat anywhere. Tequila Joe's has the only phone in reservations- and they have tasty carnitas- Storyteller breakfast is a MUST.  Every other restaurant in downtown Disney has a long wait. Some rides brokedown but we were compensated with passes, if we were in the line or has reservations.. Be aware that the haunted mansion is running just one elevator. So they are putting 50 or more...yea 50 people at a time in that little elevator. Even with 120k in people at both parks you can have fun. And we did not get covid!! 😁. Some of the spaces in waIting in line are tight. So be advised. And bring a mask if you are nervous-OLD REVIEW- park hoppers are alot of fun...but the lines are way too long and the exit strategy Disney leaves completely up to guests, and if you have a wheelchair or a stroller it can be very challenging to leave at closing time. People have no problem with cutting in front of people with children over and over again with strollers, which makes exit by the tram almost impossible at closing...they have no qualms about cutting, and they are not nice about it. Security as well as disney cast and crew are consistently no where to be found at this time. Walking the long way thru the Disney mall to Mickeys parking structure when using strollers may be a way better decision.DISNEYLAND CORP, YOU NEED TO FIX THIS, BECAUSE ITS HORRIBLE TO BE IN THIS SITUATION, PEOPLE AT YOUR TRAMS ARE ALWAYS ANGRY AND EDGY AND YOU HAVE A HUGE LIABILITY.

The park itself was decorated beautifully for Christmas.Only disappointment was the poor handling of the MASSIVE crowd on Dec 27 waiting to clear security before entering the park. People made their own lines, jumping the queue of those who had waited over 1.5 hrs. Security was ambivalent to the situation.  Disney should be better prepared to handle crowds of this size.  People were passing out.  Staff were walking by the crowds yelling, who called 911, who required medical Services - no loud hailer. There was probably over 2000 people at any given time waiting to get in. The Park was eventually closed as max capacity was reached.But all in all, a truly magical place.",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

I'll give 5 stars because Disneyland will always be my childhood home and favorite place. The nostalgia still remains and most all of the rides remain as well from when I was a child. I hope they don't remove and iconic rides. For those who want to know, tiki room and Matterhorn were both closed unfortunately. As well as the kids petting zoo on the side by big thunder mountain railroad to make room for star wars land. There are changes but fortunately they haven't closed a lot of the rides to make room for said changes and that makes me happy. Also the park doesn't feel enveloped in the new additions like California adventure is starting to feel like...still both parks recaptured my childhood and nostalgia and I had a great time showing my 2 year old around. We will try to use our annual passes we just got as much as we can although hotels and food are expensive... We just love it so much and the food is really worth it as well because it's so good and convenient!

We used fast pass for rides that had longer wait times than half hour so we could ride other rides with the 30 minutes or less wait times. All cast members were kind and seemed to be enjoying their roles with the exception of one lady in the retail store who I overheard talking trash about part timers (we've all been there but best to save it for when you are not within earshot if customers imo).Only real complaint is the lack of ability to fill up water bottles. Tried the water fountains and the water was foggy... Also could not fill the bottle all the way.

Everything is over priced. They priced everything as if this place is once in a life time experience, but that's not experience you'll expect.  The employees look like underpaid and not happy. They don't bother to do anything to help ease the heat for people in lines. Highly suggest hats for kids and elders, hack, everybody needs to wear a hat. Universal studio at least provides some fans and mist, around here, nothing,  and think about the money they make, that's really cheap, even evil, I'd say. I live 20 minutes from Disney, but from what I experienced yesterday, I would avoid going there again. There are plenty of places we can bring our kids to, and we will be much more comfort, have a lot more fun and learn a lot more.

Are they the most thrilling rides you've ever been on?  No.  The rides are all about show.  Riding roller coasters into dark rooms with music and smoke blasting into your face with all kinds of toons and characters moving and talking around every corner.

There weren't any ride closures that impacted my visit, crowds were surprisingly low (the longest waits were for the rides you'd expect- Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, etc.), and the new foods that have been introduced since my last visit were delicious. There were some refurbishments going on when we were there, but that's to be expected this time of year leading up to the popular summer months.

Come on... there is nothing I can tell you about it being a great place that you haven't already heard.What I will say is this; try not to stress.I see far too many families upset with one another trying to do everything and maximize the value of their tickets, as if the value was in the number of rides.My advice instead is to try and focus on the joy of being with the family here. Use fast passes or fast pass max if you can. Let the kids lead if they are able. And don't try to do everything. You can't. Not in one day. Probably not in five.You already spent a ton of cash (no matter how long you are staying) so don't think about that part. Just roll with it.

I thought they valued customer service more and wanted to make our trip as magical as possible buy they just said sorry I gave you this pass which makes you still wait, just half the time, but you have to wait again. They should have offered more or a partial refund if they did it hourly or voucher for food in the park or something since I had to wait 30 minutes to get on the ride, and stuck for another 35 minutes on the broken down ride.

4396,UPDATE: Very happy and appreciative that Disney came through  and did the right thing. Thank you!It's a very sad day when  A company that says it's the happiest place on Earth has terrible customer service. When I was on the app trying to buy tickets I got froze out of it several times and when I went back in inadvertently or somewhere along the line the wrong tickets got purchased and I paid for 4-4 day passes rather than 4 day passes. I didn't realize my error until my credit card bill came and the sad thing is we were only there one day and they can clearly see that. I called customer service thinking of course they would understand this but they were very rude and didn't care I had my credit card company try to get them to understand but they were no help with them either. Disneyland as a huge company and you think they could afford to give me my $984 refund very sad when somebody like that is not understanding. I bet that Walt the founder would roll over in his grave if he found out Disneyland  treating their clients like this. Very sad indeed. Where did customer service  And compassion go? I would not have even given it one star but I had to to place a review!

With the amount of people pouring in the place and getting express passes, the lines are getting longer and waiting feels like forever. Imagine lining up for at least an hour to get in a ride that will last for 3 - 5 minutes. You will have to do this almost in every ride or tour. Now, I am not saying it is the people with express passes to blame. Disneyland is just too saturated. The food inside is insanely expensive too. I guess when you are getting older and getting aware with money and cost, the magic kind of fades bit by bit.Overall, I still love Disneyland and I am still willing to come back. But, they should figure a way to help cut the waiting time shorter or add more attractions to cater more people. I love the pin trading thing they have, they should add more of something like that. What about maybe create an app like Pokemon Go but Disney version and is only available in Disney premises.

4436,"Loved it here!!! Especially the incredible roller coaster!!! But sadly the characters weren't as interactive with children as used to. And some of workers weren't as friendly nor looking as happy as they should be. For example, I am deaf I would ask the cashier how much for the haunted Disneyland castle key, she would speak but I couldn't understand her lips,  I would ask what she would repeat but same ways not try to move lips that I could lip read then she would get all annoyed that made me not wanting buy anything in that store. However there's some workers are evenly friendly and would try hard to get me understand what they're saying.So my opinion that Disneyland probably should have extra more of the same characters in different areas during the most busy seasons so they can have a bit more time to interact with the children and pictures too. The photographers did good job but they don't help to change few postures of us. They seem to  just rushing take pictures then shoo us so they can go on next families. It should be very magical experience not feeling rushed. My son loves Mickey, but everytime we tried go to Mickey for him, it's either long lines when it's nearly our turn, they would say to come back in 30 minutes or an hour when we already waited for that long or longer.

Last time we went however it seemed like most employees we encountered were pretty grumpy (maybe from the rain? Holiday season? Not sure.. ) AND there were a number of decor issues (chipped paint, dusty, etc) which was shocking to us because in the past 25+ years we've been going there is NEVER a spot of dirt or chipped paint ANYWHERE. Star Wars land was UNderwhelming! There's one ride (where you basically push some buttons on the wall when they light up.. and it's a smaller version of Star Tours) and one bar where you have to make reservations for far ahead of time. We were expecting to see some storm troopers or Darth Vader etc but not one character was walking around! Hopefully they will have more soon (pictures look great but really the whole thing's pretty small).This park is usually known for its pristine appearance - every square inch of the entire park is spotless and decorated (I heard there's a rule that trash can't be on the ground more than 20 sec), everything carefully and thoughtfully planned out. They are letting things slide which is a shame because I always felt this made them stand above the rest with this consistent extra effort. And with prices continuing to increase every year, honestly it's always a surprise to see how many people still go there. I can't believe it's $150 PER ticket for ONE day ONE park! And of course you have to eat.. best advice is go early (ideally during the week/ not during the holidays), get fast passes every few hours, utilize the single rider lines if your group is all adults, and download the Disneyland app to see wait times and other cool tidbits.

YES it is expensive, but they do allow you to bring in your own food, you don't HAVE to eat in the park (although that is arguably part of the fun). Yes the lines are long, that's because it's Disney! The only way to help that is to raise prices, obviously they could get away with raising prices even more, judging by the volume of guests they always have. If crowds really bother you try to go on a weekday, because weekends are almost always jam packed. The least crowded weekend day though? Superbowl Sunday! That being said - I don't always enjoy the crowds, and I can't afford to go very often (annual passes are a good alternative for frequent guests - they even offer monthly payment plans) but I understand that it comes with the territory. Also, for the most part the employees inside the part are very helpful and friendly as long as you initiate friendliness, but you have to keep in mind that they employ so many people, and young kids, that employees selling tickets and directing traffic don't always have the best attitude. Not that it's okay to give bad customer service or anything - I've been in the C.S. industry and I think you should always be friendly and helpful to your customers, but try not to let these first interactions set a bad tone for the trip. I feel bad for people that had a bad experience because I love Disney. It's pretty much the only place that can make me feel like a kid again.

4557,"Had a terrible experience on my last visit in the fall. I have high standards as a former cast member (at Disney World). I’ll start with how terribly congested the park was. Honestly, it was too crowded to enjoy it - constantly fighting crowds. Don’t even get me started on the ridiculous amount of strollers for big kids, we’re talking 6+. I only made it onto three attractions that day. Terrible. My husband and I got in line for StarTours and it broke down twice. After all of the waiting, by the time we were about to board, I took a moment to interact with the cast members. They did not stay in character, rather, they were referencing numerous pop songs, singing, dancing, and did not smile at guests - and barely acknowledged them. They talked about being ready for their shift to be over right in front of everyone. In addition, throughout the park, costuming was sloppy and cast members were not pleasant. My family wanted to find a seat at a patio restaurant (it’s one we traditionally would just take a seat at in years past.) I was rudely asked what I was doing when I was looking for a table and then was told, “Yeah, it’s gonna be an hour.” We left early and I don’t ever plan on returning to Disneyland unless cast member training is enforced and cast members at least act like they care about making a magical experience for guests. SAFETY did not seem to be an issue, however, COURTESY, SHOW, and EFFICIENCY are definitely lacking.As a former cast member, I know you are seriously slacking on your standards and it is not acceptable. I hope that one day I will be able to go back and have a magical day. Until serious changes happen, I’m out.",1/5,3 years ago on  Google

4564,"I was looking forward to attending this Disney park for the longest time and I finally had the chance to; however, it was extremely disappointing. The trip began with having to park 10 minutes away from the park and having to talk a bus through the park. This is extremely difficult to do when you have excited children and strollers that you would have to fold up. It was even more of a burden when returning from the park to the car when the children are asleep and having to take them out of the stroller and having to carry all of their souvenirs, the child, and the stroller onto the bus. Also, the staff at this park is extremely rude and appear to be unhappy. The staff at amusement parks have more smiles and treat the guest way better than the employees here. This of course did not include all of the employees because there were a few, and I mean less than 10 employees, that actually appeared to be happy and put their guests first. We actually asked a couple employees for directions and many were really rude.  For a park that is pretty expensive to visit you would think that the employees would be more willing to help their guests. When trying to board the bus to return to the parking lot and my family was the only group boarding this specific bus, we asked if we could leave the stroller open since the children were asleep in the stroller and she said that we must fold the stroller or we could just walk back to the parking lot. Keep in mind that it is midnight and a 10 minute drive to the parking lot. The tone and response was unnecessary for a simple question. The most infuriating thing was that my group had 3 strollers, which we would drop off in the stroller zone to hop onto a ride and the employees would move our strollers!! It was extremely annoying and a huge inconvenience because we were not told that they will move our strollers with our belongings, separate our strollers, and it would waste about 20 minutes to find all of our strollers each time. In addition to this, while watching the fireworks display near the center of the park, four employees kept telling us that we must move in the middle of the show for others to come in when we were already surrounded by people and have literally no where else to go except behind poles or tall bushes where the children cannot see. I understand that room must be made for everyone there; however, when you are pushing people into an area that is already packed with people and interrupting the display many times for others to squeeze in is just impolite and interrupts the show that we are paying for. For what my family was able to enjoy, the firework show was amazing and super entertaining. The parade was also super cute and a lot of fun to attend and if you do go to this park, I do recommend making time to attend that parade. In addition to that, the face characters were super accurate visually and with their personality. Unfortunately, more negatives on my experience than positives. The park did not have the magic as described or advertised and it was very sad and disappointing. I have been to Disney World many times over the past 18 years and every enjoyed every minute of it and always looking forward to the next visit. I will never go back to this park based on this experience I had and will definitely advise others to do the same. This review is not meant to demote or talk negative on the Disney brand because I absolutely love Disney and what they provide, I just was too disappointed on the quality of the employees and experience I have had. I do recommend visiting Disney World instead to actually feel and experience the magic that people and advertisements describe.",2/5,4 years ago on  Google

I wonder if they have a limit for attendance?  I am handicapped and use a scooter. They didn't explain the rising info very well.  It was such a struggle to get on a ride. We were only told to go to the fast pass line. In actuality you go to the fast pass line, actually get a fast pass time and then return. As this data was busier and more crowded than I have ever experienced at a Disney park, returning later was very difficult. Also, some of the staff working on boarding and deboarding were not friendly or very helpful. Some were great, but some just weren't!

I asked another staff member on why he said that, she mentioned that he probably meant to leave the place as they will open the barricades for walking across the street. Is the previous staff member a Robot not to tell his intentions in meaningful way. End of the day, we go here to relax and it's not cheap either. I wish I just not gone here. Getting this kind of respect tells me that, these resorts are not going to be active in next 10 years unless the management thinks differently and invest time in respecting activities and quality of people who help/entertain customers.

Super friendly staff, and a nice atmosphere. Only complaints were that it was hard to find an open place serving breakfast, and the number of guests who brought/rented MASSIVE strollers to use them as shopping carts/luggage trollies, because the stroller parking outside each ride was a huge obstruction everywhere.

The rides are fun, the food is great, and the atmosphere is fantastic! I love hearing all the sounds and smelling the food as I'm walking through each land.My advice for people who want to go, especially first timers, is to research about the park before you go. Check out the prices, food, rides, and everything else that'll make your trip easier and more enjoyable because once you're there, you'll be overwhelmed with so many things you want to do. Then plan what you'll need in the park (water bottles, sun block, camera, phone, first aid, etc.) and take like a small bag/rucksack with you so it'll be easier to carry things (oh and ladies make sure your bags don't have just one strap. Carrying the weight on one shoulder for the whole day can really strain your muscles). And of course, comfy shoes with air circulation.Anyways, my point is that Disneyland can be an incredible experience for you and your loved ones. A little planning goes a long way and can really save you some time and headaches later. And once you're there, have fun! Go with a positive attitude and a smile.

So crowded you couldn't walk in a straight line or without bumping into someone. When the rope drops,  I always feared for the safety of my children bc people stampede to get to their first ride. I saw several people get hurt. 80% of the people I came in contact with were very rude.  In the park and all of southern California.  The rides were great but everything in the park was incredibly over priced.  For the price,  the food was not that great.  The only place we ate that was good and reasonably priced was Bengal BBQ but they still give very little quantity.For the park being so packed, many people didn't want to share public space.  And it's almost impossible to watch a show,  parade or fire works without people being incredibly rude or the cast members making you move unless you wanna wait in one spot for 2 hours or more.  So if you only get to go to the park once bc you live far away or just can't afford it,  I'd suggest not catching any of the shows.  You'll miss out on too much fun just waiting.It was a very stressful trip to say the least.  Even my kids ( 12 & 13)  didn't like it bc of these reasons.

Likewise some things I prefer at Disney World. I wouldn’t say one is nicer than the other, just different. Even the same corresponding rides are different at each park. For example, I found the Haunted Mansion and It’s a Small World to be nicer here and Splash Mountain better at Disney World. I love that they have a parking deck at Disneyland. It’s only been there since 2001 or so because where California Adventure is now is what used to be part of their parking lot. I think it looks very nice that the sidewalks are brick as a pass to the pink colored concrete of Disney World. The brick looks more aesthetically pleasing. Cinderella’s castle at Magic Kingdom Florida is prettier though I think it looks very nice that the sidewalks are brick as opposed to the pink colored concrete of Disney World.

Also great for couples since most of the rides are two seated, therefore it usually pairs you with another person. Lines are usually long, but you can get fast passes which will allow you to skip most of the lines.For ten extra dollars, you can accumulate fast pass on your phone so instead of going to the ride entrance and receiving fast passes, you can just do it by your phone, which is extremely useful if you're waiting in line.

4722,"It's Disneyland, they are the friendliest of all with awesome rides and even better food (at extremely expensive prices--but nonetheless great food).Update: I feel disappointed. I've been a Disney fan all my life. Growing up in SoCal I have always made it a point to come to the park at least once a year with or without the annual pass. This time we opted for no annual pass since I've noticed that the value for the money is no longer there. $1k for a pass that may or may not allow you to enter a park at any given day even though it says no black outs on it. A Disney app system that encourages you to order on your mobile app for food that clearly does not work. If I had a suggestion for any reader it would be to add yourself to the waiting queue for food while you order meal because it took me equally as long to wait in line and try to have the app function just to add my credit card on file to order food. On top of that, I saw in one restaurant (pymm tasting) where only 1 cashier was dedicated to in person food orders for debit only, another cashier for cash only (which obviously no one had) and 3-4 cashier's standing aimlessly waiting for online mobile orders. It baffles my mind to see that all those workers were just standing there not helping the ridiculously long line of 40 mins because they're waiting for any mobile order to come thru. To make things even better, they've taken away the tram system and the fast pass system which allowed any family to join the ride for free at a faster time. This didn't feel like the happiest place on earth, this felt guided by money and seeing large families with kids struggling with how to approach this situation broke my heart. I am an adult with no kids, but I grew up thinking Disney was for everyone. Not anymore, it's been made solely for people like me, with no kids and money to burn. It doesn't feel right, Disney was for everyone.",2/5,a year ago on  Google

There are no places on Earth like Disney World resorts. They are simply spectacular. Having been a part of this fun, I can say to you that bringing your family once in your lifetime or more is certainly the right choice.  Disney world is magical. Its youthful. It's dreamy.  It is full of fun and laughter. It's exciting, suspenseful, and breathtaking. There are miles and miles of park to walk and enjoy the scenery, rides, and great food.  The workers at Disney World are trained impeccably. It is the customer first.  It takes days to cover this entire park properly but it is worth spending and entire week here and soaking it up a little-by-little. If you haven't done it already and you're an adult, go back to being the child and plan a trip to Disney World. Thank God for Walt Disney himself.  Make sure you save a lot of money, because it's expensive and so is the food. But it is well worth the trip, the time, the love and the happiness it brings to your children. Go there soon!!!!

With all theses break downs and closures you think a multi-national corporation could offer some kind of discount... Nope, not Disney, they still remains the most expensive. In addition, even on the days that it is quiet you are still are shoulder to shoulder with people and due to the lack of user orientated design the park remains a confusing mess around every corner.

If you are going with kids you need all the patience in the world. The rides that are crazy fun are always, and I mean always packed. Now I know what your gonna say, ""it's an amusement park of course things are overpriced and the lines are long"". But we shouldn't make excuses for them just cause they are Disney, in fact we should expect a better experience given how much they make in profit. Trust me they can afford not to charge you so much. I suggest going to Knotts of even universal studios. Unless you are willing to buy a pass to Disney, live close by, and purchase a fast pass, it's to stressful.

Another thing I recommend is, downloading the disneyland app. Gives you the wait time on the rides and helps out with fast passes. This park does not provide alcohol. But make sure you bring your snacks.",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

I know what you're thinking ""the kids have school and I have work."" Take some vacation time and pull the kids out of school. It  will be worth it when you have the run of the park with 20 min or less average wait times.Disneyland if you're reading this I have a few suggestions to make your park better.1) more water fountains and for the love of all things please add water bottle filling stations to those water fountains. It is the least you can do to help the parks be a little more Green2) young child directions. We weren't sure if our 1 year old should have been riding in our lap or in the seat or what. It would have been good to know what the best way for her to ride was.3) Cooling areas. It was really hot and humid while we were there. It would have been great if there were a few more cooling stations.4) A place for young children to nap. I know you already offer an infant lounge, and it is a long shot but having a quiet place where the little ones can rest up for more fun would make it a lot easier on the parents.",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

I'm not even joking. At this point I wanted to cry, I was so upset and embarrassed. My husband pointed out the obvious flaw in his logic, and we were made to go a different way and get into a whole extra line.Overall it was a very expensive day, several times we were given the wrong way to get onto the rides and ended up waiting longer, and it was very frustrating that they didn't seem to train their employees on what not to say to people in wheelchairs.",2/5,3 years ago on  Google

We did have a good time but I seem to put Disney on a higher standard which I don't think they reached.   I would definitely go back.  I would even recommend it if you were on the west coast.

Literally it's all in the city center and the castles. Some of the rides were short for waiting an hour plus in line. I was surprised that some of the rides look original to the park. Like the toy/doll displays and such. It was ok. It would be nice if there were less crowds. It doesnt seem enjoyable for people in wheelchairs,  I saw alot of wheelchair folks stuck in crowds. Christmas week seems like the most hectic in my opinion. Also, would be nice to see general store places for tylenol and feminine products. I was surprised to see they didnt have anything anywhere to carry these items.The lines are enormous.  We got through 4 rides in one day, one with a max pass! It's an experience but dont know if I'll be back. Going to try some of the other local attractions. Dont know how people do this attraction with a big family. Were a family of 6 and I thought it was a test of patience from waiting in line to being yelled at by various Disneyland members while waiting in line. It felt like they were rushing us through, which, yes it was extremely busy but felt like cattle herding.Also, during security check in a security person joked around that I couldn't bring a glass bottle, I said ok, fine throw it away, I like to use glass not plastic.

Twice I explained,  third time I pointed out it was neither his business nor will I offer another explanation having done so twice in the past minute.  To that he became outright aggressive.  Not a fun experience.The park was as good as always minus a few snags.  The trash was not picked up as quickly as usual and I witnessed a few signs of neglect like broken shutters in one of my photos.The starwars ride was good, but the new land overall has not lived up to its' hype.  There is  not a whole lot to do unless you want to spend an additional $100 to build a droid or buy a $5.50 can of coke that looks like a cheap plastic toy.Overall still a good experience but I suggest that Disney works a little harder on customer support and attention to details like they used to.Another thing that bothered me was fantasmic.  To watch the show from close by you have to purchase dining package and spend an hour standing in place to save your spot.  Unless... you are celebrity.  They get a special section with real chairs and premium views.  Like being a world famous reality show star is not offering enough perks.  I have spent over 5k in 5 days here, but I suppose it's not quite enough to get a folding chair and not being treated like canned sardines.

But one of my only disappointments was the lack of professional photographers on hand next to the characters that we waited in line to meet. We had upgraded to a Max Pass which included a photo pass yet we only had one session of professional photos throughout the entire day even though we met 8 characters and were there for 12 hours! I was so frustrated that we didn’t get more professional quality images. My other slight annoyance was in the lack of phone charging outlets. It’s a long day of using your phone with the Disney app to navigate on the map and request fast passes plus my phone was also my main camera since the professional photographers are limited. So by the evening, my battery was drained yet I had nowhere to charge even though I had brought my charging cord with me. But aside from those 2 complaints, it truly was an amazing family day that I will always look back on fondly. Loved the rides and the atmosphere!",4/5,2 years ago on  Google

The worst thing that I've experienced here is how bad and expensive the pizza is at toontown or whatever it's called. I've been to Disneyland a few times now and it never gets old. Matterhorn Bobsleds is my favorite ride and is absolutely terrific if you ride it at night. Space mountain has changed a lot but in my opinion it was for the better. Thunder Mountain will always be one of my top favorites. And finally, splash mountain always amazes me and also succeeds to scare me to death. Pirates of the caribbean just gives you a very dream-like experience. And the haunted mansion never fails to scare me yet make me super happy. Yes, the lines are very long, but it is a super popular theme park so what do you expect? If it truely does take you an entire day to ride ""only three"" rides then you obviously didn't get there at the beginning of the day. Food is at a reasonable price for most places to eat considering how busy it is.

5029,"In 1955 when I was 9 months old, I moved to Anaheim to a brand new house just two miles from the Park. Without realizing it, I was one of the first toddlers to visit Disneyland using one of their rented turquoise strollers. For the next 9 years, I visited the magic kingdom about six times each year, loving every minute of it. My father would go out of town on business and upon his return, LAX utilized a helicopter service that shuttled customers to the Anaheim area by landing in the Disneyland Hotel parking lot..When we had really hot summers, I'd ride my bike in my front yard while watching the nightly fireworks and hearing the concussions of each display...what great memories.Fast forward to 1993...my mom had just died and I was overcome with grief. My children were ages 8 and 10 and my husband asked me to consider a trip to Disneyland..so we drove from Washington state, and my children will never forget driving up to the Disneyland sign and squealing with delight...or all the numerous times after...as they are now 32 and 34.Yes, lines are long.Yes, prices are up there.But please, people. This park is worth all the time and effort, the expense, the crowds. Disneyland is a clean and safe place to bring your families and most amusement sites cannot boast that.

The tickets are pricey which is one of the few cons.Our favorite rides are still Thunder Mountain, Matterhorn and Indiana Jones. I recommend getting the fast pass for these.We saw and engaged with way more characters than we expected. If you get 3 day pass then you get one ""Magic Morning"" which means you are allowed to enter the park 1-hour early. But beware that you can only do that on certain days of the week so plan accordingly! It was on the Magic Morning that we got in 1-hour early and saw a bunch of characters with little to no wait.As you can imagine, eating in the park is fairly expensive but I saw lots of people bring in their own foods and snacks.

I have a family of 4 and we had a  great time. Our hotel was within walking distance from the park and with planning and timing we were able to wait only 10 mins through security and check in combined. I see a lot of negativity about lines and prices and what not but it a huge theme park. What were they expecting? With common sense and proper planning a great time can be expected. My only issue was the rides. As a family, we were able to do 10-15 rides a day, including fastpass. For example we would do one for 11 and do other things and book more passes after the 90 min between each pass. But, I waited 45 mins in line for the Incredicoaster and they closed the ride down. Then we got in line for Monsters Inc. closed it again. We were lucky to have gotten to go on the Pirates ride as it closed a whopping total of 6 times over a 2 day period for matinence. We also got stuck on the cars ride near and exit for a good 30 mins which really got me going because we were at the end of the ride but the car in front of us broke down and the employees wouldn’t let us off. While this was happening, our long awaited fast pass that was for space mountain ( we had been waiting 2 whole days for this ride) had expired and we ended up not being able to ride on it as the wait time stayed consistently at 90+ mins. The iconic structure everyone knows is the castle, which is closed for refurbishing sucked because we always come for the fireworks and parade but this time they did something else which wasn’t as cool or eventful as their memorable firework and parade show Overall, the park is always a fun time.

Also I am handicapped and cannot ride any of the rides but I still had to pay for a full price ticket.

Merchandise and food is good,  but pricey. Lines for rides are what they are. Always use a fast pass for Space Mountain and Splash Mountain after 12 pm.

For this price you can buy a whole bag. :( Star wars experience is too much hyped for what you are getting. Also cantina restaurant cannot offer something nice to try out. Food service in the park can learn a bit something about good food making (healthy + tasty)",4/5,3 years ago on  Google
5168,I won't say I had a bad experience of Disneyland but as far as parking and checking bags I am very disappointed. For this to be a popular theme park it's very unorganized on letting people know what they can and cannot bring. The first day I came I went through no problems with my selfie stick the second day I parked at the garage went through check point to only be turned around from one of the workers who had a nasty attitude stating take it back to the car or we keep it and you don't get it back .

Have to wait 2 hrs to collect fast passes for another ride, the explanation was that the annual ticket holders ruined it for everyone wanting to arrange your plan for rides.

5171,Overpriced Everything. More profit more waiting in. Lines. For. Hours. The funny thing is is that I brought my youngest daughter here because she doesn't remember ever being here as baby and come to find out that you know the drinks are $6 and the food is like $15 for a plate. And then you have to wait 2 hours to get on a ride. So I did decided to make more profit more money and do less for the consumer. Ticket prices will cost about $200 and 20 for parking that's for two people. Expect to spend about $100 per person if you're going to be there for the full day and you have to wait for everybody to leave before you can actually experience the rides without waiting in line.

We were told “Go get a fast pass”, and were told because someone abused the disabled system two years ago, they no longer offer aid for the disabled.  So someone abused something, let’s just take everything away from those who really need it!  How about a system of giving the handicapped a special pass as they enter the parking lot with their handicapped placard.  Would this not allow those who are truly disabled an opportunity to use the necessary aid and those who would abuse it the inability to do so?

The rides are okay, outside of a few stand outs - Ratatouille, Hollywood Tower, Runaway Train and Space Mountain - they are all great.One of the big reasons for the atmosphere is its like a gated community of rich people. The costs so disproportionate you end up with forty thousand middle class people. We ended up taking coke bottles back and filling them with blackcurrant juice. There is no refillable option like you find in other theme parks. The costs are way over the top, fortunately we had half board. The bill for one meal of burgers and chips with icecream topped 200 Euros (Anne belles I think, its a 50s diner outside the 2 main parks you can use your half board there). Absolutely crazy price for any normal person - usually 60 quid max.The saving grace is the big parade which is brilliant and the 8pm fireworks. One thing I did notice is the fireworks are mostly lights and water with a few fireworks here and there. I think the way the castle lights up and the likes of lion King or star wars bursts out are what makes it special.One last thing I will mention are the unhelpful staff.

5238,"Big Disney fan my whole life. I've been on multiple trips to Disneyland, Disney World, and Disneyland in Paris throughout my life. I loved them all. Our last trip to Disneyland (September 2018) was a complete nightmare. We picked one of the lowest seasons of the year, knowing that some rides and attractions would be closed. It was worth it for us because we thought we would be avoiding big crowds.Instead, we found many many rides closed, AND the biggest crowds we have ever seen there. Incredibly hard to walk around and get anywhere. Long lines at all the rides. Families stressed out and rushing all over the park. Horrible, horrible atmosphere.The magic is completely GONE. You can't even appreciate the beauty of the park because people are in the way. People are EVERYWHERE.If anyone remembers the magic and the music and simply strolling around and enjoying everything in sight (during low season), that is gone forever.All we found were stressed out moms, sweating and pulling their kids all over the park, racing to get to rides before everyone else did. If you don't rush, you're doomed.Remember when you would run into characters and actually be able to spend some time with them? That does not happen anymore. If you want to spend 3 seconds with Minnie, stand in line for at least 20min. If you're lucky, you'll get to her. Normally you won't, and have to wait some more for the next character. If you want to say hi to Captain America or Spiderman or Black Panther, be prepared to wait in line for 40min or longer.This is LOW SEASON, people. I can't even imagine the park being fuller than it was. It seemed impossible to us that more people could fit. But when we went, crowd levels were at 2/10!!!!Cast members are no longer kind and warm. They are all completely stressed out and rude and even mean. No wonder. Their job of keeping things together is very hard.Horrible, horrible and very disappointing experience for my whole family. I had spent years telling my kids all about the magic of Disneyland, and none of it is left.If Disney doesn't limit crowds somehow, I don't think we'll ever be going back. The park is beautiful.

Best best best place. My favourite rides are star wars 3D ride , airplaneplane simulation, minions ride, Simpsons ride, transformers ...meeting princess like Cinderella, belle and snow-white in castle and met Alladin too. Construction of place is so beautiful 😍 it feels like a dream or fairytale. I would love to go there again n again. I recommend you to wear casual comfortable shoes there because you have to walk around a lot. Wear comfy clothes too. Shopping there is expensive though. You can bring your own food I think. ♥️♥️♥️♥️ Try to arrive early there because you gotta experience everything and every rides. 💯 Because its ends a little early ..... Get the map too. If you want to skip lines then you can get fast passes too🌺😋😋♥️♥️♥️💯💯💯. Park your car near elevator it will be convenient for you to commute faster. Keep your things safe and or at a locker room. ✌️ Take your water bottle always keep yourself hydrated 💙💦.  Keep your phone battery alive and do not forget to take pictures there .... Because its the best place to take pictures. 🌺🌺🌺🌸🌸🌸🌸😍💐. Its a good idea if you take a camera DSLR with you. 😎😎  kids love being there ... You will definitely see Donald duck, miçkey mouse , minie mouse, goofy and there club house 💯♥️🔥. It's cute and fun to go with kids there. 🍄They have theatre shows ... And my favourite Flynn rider and Rapunzel from ""Tangled"".

5253,"For those that can afford it, Disneyland is indeed the ""Happiest Place on Earth"" but for the rest, it's the ""Most expensive place on earth."" But regardless of which category you fall into, we can agree it's the ""most crowded place on earth"".Unfortunately like everyone else, we can only visit during the holidays when schools out, and so does everyone else. Wait time in lines can take in excess of 45 minutes, but with most attractions you can get a number and come back on the tickets' designated time. The staff here truly do try to make your experience the happiest place on earth (even though I suspect most are making near minimum wages).If you don't like the wait Disney does have other more expensive options to make the line wait more bearable.",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

The check-in staff at the entrance trashed all sealed bottles of water, granola bars, fruits, and even cough drops. The entire park offers a lack of access to water fountains which forces visitors to pay top $ for water bottles. That's an act of being greedy. Furthermore, Only a few park eateries (limited choices of foods) were opened during the later hours knowing that these HS grad night visitors stayed until after midnight. Talking about the parks policies! When my daughter checked the website rules for prohibited items there were no rules regulating outside food, there was only an exclusion to alcohol and glass containers. When this was brought to attention the check-in security said that those rules apply to ""regular guests"" as if the students weren't attending Disney as people who payed regular prices(plus private bus fare) to attend the park regularly except for the fact that they get to stay after hours, which shouldn't have an affect on what food they can't bring. The least they can do is allow students to bring sealed bottles of water in, but NO not even that was an exception. That's absolutely ridiculous. I hope Disney pays attention to this matter closely. You can't promote the ""happiest place on earth"" without creating ""happy crowds"". In addition to taking away food and water, when students were allowed into California adventure while the ""regular guests"" were being escorted out, there were only a couple of rides open to the students.

5323,"I get the point of Disneyland, it's for kids, but its ridiculous how they charge you so much just to go in and not be able to do anything. I'm pretty sure they purposely overcrowd the park so you cant get on the rides just so all you can do is buy more stuff. The first night we waited 4 hours to watch the fireworks and they told us 5 minutes before they were supposed to go off that they cancelled them. They purposely waited just so people wouldn't leave and you have to buy stuff to feed and entertain your kids. I honestly believe it's a scam. And the fastpass is useless if you want to go on more than 1 ride..",1/5,4 years ago on  Google

We waited in line and heard that Anna might not be there during our wait but we voiced how much it meant to our daughter and they came through for us. To see the magic happen with our daughter meeting both Anna and Elsa and the professionalism and authenticity the ladies used playing their role was moving. Actually even the cast members we spoke to while moving through the line at the front really impressed me. It is exactly the reason we are season pass members and why we have to come back as often as we can. I wish I remembered the names of all the other cast members as well but I really have a feeling that Alex played a major role in making that happen and the others went with it and I just want to say thank you and hope that you recognize them.",5/5,2 years ago on  Google

Only one smoking area in the park?  and now none at all, you need to leave the park to smoke.

There were some rides like Haunted Manson and Toy Story that I was really looking forward to that were ""temporarily closed"" a lot of the time, which was disappointing. My only other complaint is that the food and merchandise prices are squarely in the realm of absurdity! The profit margin on some of the items had to be pushing 1000%+, which is just greedy.

I came with my wife and a 12 months old baby girl the lines were super long. I paid two tickets 1 Park Peak 1 Day ticket for $124.00 each and it’s not worthy to come in the weekend. You won’t enjoyed your $124.00 ticket. I bet. This  Christmas they do not even have good Xmas decors and their last Christmas parade finished at 15:30. Which I was hoping to see in the evening expecting beautiful lights like last year they had this show called painted lights. Yesterday was my worse experience on Disney Park ever and if I were you I would not choose the Peak time dates because you won’t enjoy the time there. I would booked a regular day ticket for my family maybe next time I come visit to LA again. When that happened I would have entire park just for us. Parking is $20.00 but it’s worthy rather than you go take hotel shuttle that has time for them to pick you up back again and tip your driver. I paid parking and stay time whenever I would like to.

5516,"I was shocked by how bad the service was. I was at Disney Orlando, and the place was magical, more for the service than anything else. In Disneyland, the people are always yelling at us while they herd us through rides/shows. Most of the staff are not friendly - they actually look miserable to be there. It put a damper on everything, even though the rides and setting are very similar to DisneyWorld. Hard to believe it's run by the same people. The service at Universal was 110% better, even if the park is smaller. Also, Disneyland is dirty and does not offer the same kinds of parades. We found cockroaches on Main St. Walt must be rolling over in his grave.We also ate at one of the restaurants, where some of the servings were super tiny, though very expensive. The place had zero ambiance, and didn't have a bathroom - you had to walk out to the park to go.On the positive side, there are a lot of good rides. The fast pass is totally worth the extra $50 we had to pay for our family (it's much, much more expensive at Universal). We hardly waited in lines at all.Last warning: be sure never to drop your phone while on a ride. You will not get it back until the end of the day, if at all. So make sure it's locked up safely on you.",2/5,4 years ago on  Google

Bring snacks and pack a lunch, you can rent a locker and place your lunch there so that you can save money while in the park.The snacks are for while your waiting in lines and if you have small kids you can use them to help them while waiting.Send 1 person with the bags through the security line and another to wait in the entrance line so that once your through security you won't have to wait to get into the park.Also if you can get the max pass it is worth it so you don't have to run to get fast passes, also with that you can get all the pictures they take of you, then get in front of every camera you can so you have a lot of great looking professional shots.Don't stress!

Next was the Matterhorn was a complete joke letting fast pass and single riders go over standby turned a 60min wait time to 165 wait time, that was unjust and we missed the ride, it is a single rider ride that should balance all who are let on. Fast pass is unbalanced, a better system needs to be considered.Disneyland doesn’t even compare to Disney World, it was probably the most upsetting visit  out of them all, one thing I would like to say if you are going to spend the money, go to Disney World unless it’s not convenient, but you absolutely cannot compare the two, World is truly magical compared to Land.",3/5,3 years ago on  Google

5622,"Its expensive and I'm sure anyone looking to going in knows that already but everything in the park is overpriced for sure. Fast pass is the only way to really getting on to rides without long standby times that will greatly increase the experience there and kind of teach you time management but will end up having you run around the park make your scheduled appointments around Disneyland but without it youd spend more sitting and wasting time between rides. I've heard of people waiting in lines for 90 mins up to 3 hours to get onto a single ride which I think is ridiculous considering the amount of money you pay to get on a ride. The character lines can be pretty long too but getting a character or princess breakfast will also make that experience better because you get a good meal while also waiting to have a character visit, which is a must if you have little ones. The time they spend at the table is good enough for the kids to get out a rant and hug and multiple photos but it can also be a bit costly although considering the line to see those characters can eat up 30 to 60 mins of your visit might make it worth it.Tldr: the added expenses make it worth it and give you more value than just admission and waiting alone.

Most of the rides are works of genius and I can almost understand why people would queue for 2+ hours for a ride on a weekend (we were there mid-week and it was still crazy busy). But it kinda missed the “magical” mark for me...I’ve been brought up believing that Disney staff were immersed in the Disney culture and exude happiness and excitement that is worthy of replicating in all businesses. I didn’t see it. We had only one “Have a magical day” at the entrance on day 2 of our visit with no eye contact, smile and while they were moving on to the next person. We experienced staff slouching on the FastPass scanning machines and just generally nothing that left me feeling like I was at the happiest place on earth.The app and the pass are good at forcing you to plan...which is the only way you’ll see full value for your visit here. Although I’m not naive enough to believe that $10/day each would be sufficient to buy you first class immediate access to everything, we did feel that the limited number of passes really only add a little advantage. Nonetheless, (especially if you’re fit and able to get around fast as we did - without kids with us) the pass can change your experience if you know exactly what you want to do and FastPass access is available for those activities...just take the time to understand how it works and when you can book your next event/ride...and then check it regularly for other FastPass-available activities.Finally, in the space of literally a couple of hours we personally experienced 2 rides that were closed for technical issues (I know, stuff happens), but heard of others when chatting to folks in the queues...where you have heaps of bonding time.I’m thrilled that I’ve now done Disneyland (my partner had been before) and totally enjoyed the rides and energy.

5732,"Great for children, not so much for adults. Most items sold whether decoration, clothing, food, or other misc. Items are mediocre at best for the price. For a park as lucrative as it is, you would think having nice fresh delicious foods would be as important as having well kept attractions. The fact that you can order Disney type clothing and wares from Amazon for half the price of the actual Disney park leaves you with only one reason to go here and that is to ride rides. However for people with children too small for rides that go here for the characters and the parades and smaller events, it is overly crowded with extensive wait times and unless you bum rush characters you may risk not taking photos with them at all. 100+ dollars to spend a day here waiting in line for miniscule memories is not worth it. You can spend 150 bucks on an annual pass for sea world and enjoy experiences 365 whereas to get this same opportunity with Disney you will spend 1300 dollars with small perks like parking and a percentage off of merchandise... definitely something to think over.

Be prepared to pay a lot, stand around a lot in really long lines, get super exhausted, and all while having a great time with your family and friends. It used to be that if you went on weekends, it was crowded and less so on weekdays. That is no longer true because no matter the day, it's now always crowded. Disneyland is a place of fairy tales coming to life. It's where you go to see your favorite childhood characters come to life and you get to explore in their fantasy world. This is what makes Disneyland a great place for all ages. You have rides that cater to the smallest child all the way to the fully-grown adult with an inner child. MUST SEE RIDES: Indiana Jones, Star Tours, Haunted Mansion, Matterhorn Bobsleds, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. They're all really good and you can't go wrong just spending time there with family/friends. You have to eat a Churro while you're there, a great combination of cinnamon and sugar you won't regret. Shows help enhance the experience and really help you travel further into the story behind each ""land"" so make time for those. Fireworks are unforgettable at night and are a definite must see. Keep in mind everything there is subject to change depending on weather and other factors so plan accordingly.

We walked onto almost every ride and did the majority of our souvenir shopping. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to literally run through the park. We did a dozen rides in just over an hour including 3 or 4 of the longer waits.The second day at the park was tiring. We started at the Magic Hour and made it until 3pm before taking a much needed nap back at the hotel.This was the day where MagicPass was necessary. Lines were hours long. People were everywhere and still every cast member was friendly and helpful. Pluto stole my daughter's autograph book and ran away. Minnie told us to go ask Mickey about that wedding ring. It was perfect.This is where the real magic happened. On my way back to the hotel I discovered that I'd lost my $250 sunglasses on the Star Tours ride. A quick check of my photos confirmed that I had them on before. But not after.As we came back to the park hours later with trepidation I approached a friendly cast member.

5781,"It's crowded, expensive and you shouldnt have to pay the extra to take advantage of scheduling rides (MaxPass). But it's a whole lot of fun. And that's coming from a middle aged man without any tendencies to collect Star Wars figurines or Mickey Mouse hats.For maximum fun, build your own lightsaber and hang out at the Black Spire. On occasions you'll get harassed by storm troopers which is a laugh.Whatever you do, try the following:- Survive the drive on LA's infamous freeways. We stayed around Hollywood Hills and the drive to Disneyland was...well, I liked it. But, five (and I counted six on on occasion) lanes makes for real, live, Deathrace 2000. Rev up your rented V8 and enjoy!- Remember where you parked your car. You'll get a Disney character, a colour and a letter that changes on the same level. Remember all three. Otherwise you'll wander around aimlessly trying to figure out where the V8 lies.- Get ready to walk, kids! You'll be walking all day. So wear comfortable shoes.- Snow ain't snow. The snow they fire at night attracts kids like flies to a day-old doner kebab. Unfortunately, when they put their tongues out to catch the snow, suggest they don't - it isn't real snow they'll be eating.- Get the MaxPass / FastPass. It's worth it. Big / awesome rides are popular. MaxPass allows you to schedule a ride later. Couple of caveats:* If you use the Maxpass to schedule a ride, you disable it for up to an hour and a half. In other words, you can't schedule anything else in that time. In quiet times, the disabled period is less.* There will still be a queue for you to manage once you get to your ride, but inevitably, it'll be a LOT smaller....so, a good strategy with the above in mind is to book a big ride as soon as you arrive in the park. Between that, look for rides that you don't have to wait as long to keep the volk amused. Refresh the app (get the Disney app!) when you are looking to rebook another ride - the queues are dynamic and will shorten or lengthen. If they shorten - schedule a ride immediately. Using this approach, expect to schedule around five or six big rides in a day. If you don't use MaxPass, you can still manage the same, but you'll spend the remainder of your time queuing.To summarise, we had an awful lot of fun. I wasn't a huge fan of the food or the food prices...nor was I into collecting Disney memorabilia (which the shops are full of). But in general, it was an amazing place that we all enjoyed. For the curious, our split between Disneyland and California Adventure Park over three days was Disney - Cali - Disney.

My family freezes fruit and eats it for the whole day. Definitely bring your walking shoes because this place is no joke when it comes to getting your steps in. Fast passes make lines a breeze. I loved going on weekday mornings when it's very low traffic. One of the employees even did a mini photo shoot for my boyfriend and I. This place is expensive but worth every penny. Your experience is what you make it :),5/5,4 years ago on  Google

5805,This was our family's first trip to Disneyland and it will probably be the last. We went on June 6th apparently one of the busiest days of the year. Coming from Kentucky we did not know this. It was chaos everywhere. We arrived around 11am and got to ride a few rides and meet with a couple of characters. After that we were unable to ride anything due to the long wait times. Everything was so expensive. We have a family of six so it wasn't cheap just to get in. I feel like we paid to sit in line all day and have our kids trampled by strangers. Then at the end o the night we lost a child in a store that should have been closed due to capacity. I will say the staff was very helpful in finding the child. If Walt Disney could see what it has become today he would probably call it the most stressful and miserable place on earth unless you have only one child.,1/5,6 years ago on  Google

Unless you want to splurge, don't bother staying on property.

5824,"Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It is the oldest Disney Park in the world.Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot.Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits since it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had approximately 18.6 million visits, making it the second most visited amusement park in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom, the very park it inspired.According to a March 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are supported by the Disneyland Resort, including about 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent contractors or their employees).Disney announced ""Project Stardust"" in 2019, which included major structural renovations to the park to account for higher attendance numbers.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

We couldn't even get pictures with characters because the lines were too long or they were always about to leave at the time we walked up. They have this feature called the fast pass for rides but nobody explained it to us and we didn't have an opportunity to learn how it worked until day 2 at Disney's California Adventure park, which was a much better experience.

You can't miss something you've never experienced.Here's the short story: Lines are long, almost everything is expensive, it can be hot some days, and you're going to need more than a day to experience everything. But Disneyland is definitely magical. The place is perfectly manicured, most everyone who works there is wonderful and nice, everything is maintained well, and I trust them with my life.The long story: This place is super high maintenance. People who don't know or think about it may take this place for granted until they go to another amusement park where everything is a disappointment. It's true, it happened to me. I loved going to Disneyland, but I didn't really pay attention to why until I got a free admission to another theme park. And boy, was I appalled at everything at that different theme park from the employees to the questionable rides that I refused to go on, to the smelly and gross bathrooms. And it was a similar experience at another smaller theme park, but the crowds weren't as bad. I came back to Disneyland and realized how much effort, money, and magic they put into everything at Disneyland. The place is immaculate. You can't find gum stuck under any table if you went looking for it. Everything you see, hear, feel, touch, and eat is planned by someone at Disney and it's very much under appreciated. Even the occasional stinky bathroom is maintained well, especially with the number of people that go in and out in just an hour. Every flower, every tree is perfect. Take a look next time you're there and see that even the horse drawing a carriage is a handsome Disney horse. Go ahead, look at the horse and tell me he's not a beauty! The food has been knocking it out of the park and very unlike the other theme park's food. Did you know they do all the maintenance work at night? Trimming trees or painting walls or decorating for Halloween or Christmas etc everything is done overnight. I feel like I can go on the Guardians or the Incredicoaster 200 times a day and never worry about my safety. Every surface is clean, especially with so many kids running around and touching everything. A pretty penny is worth spending here if you have it.

5861,"It is an amazing park, and anyone who is heading to LA should go to experience it at least once. I had an amazing time there! I would definitely recommend staying for the night time because it's so magical with all of the lights. I gave it 4 stars for a few reasons...Firstly it doesnt have any ""extreme rides"" (highest on the thrill scale is like a 6/10ish). I understand it's primarily aimed at kids, but it's ultimately a family park meaning it should cater to everyone (i.e six flags has a large variety of rides).Sadly everyone does hype it up to be the most amazing place on earth, so if you go in with very high expectations, you may feel slightly underwhelmed. The best way to combat this is to take it as it comes and enjoy it for what it is, instead of what you think/imagined it to be, it truly is a place of wonder.Lastly is the lines, everyone wants to go and this definitely shows, be ready for literal hoards of people, and to be overwhelmed at least once haha. Make use of the fast pass and do your best to avoid weekends/holidays and peak season periods, otherwise you may only get 5 rides in a day, if that (depending on your ride of choice). A good idea is to use the magic morning because you get in an hour early meaning you can beat everyone to the rides the fill up quickly so you don't have to wait around 3 hours later in the day.Overall it really is a great park, especially when you have the nostalgia of watching all of the Disney movies as a kid etc., It's better experienced over multiple days so you have more time to stop and smell the roses, otherwise you're trying to cram it all in. Just remember that it is what you make of it. Do your research. Come with a plan and be flexible with the lines and times. You'll have a great time :)",4/5,4 years ago on  Google

Personally I wouldn't recommend going during summer weekends or the last couple weeks of December because those are the busiest days. If you have an annual pass, I would also recommend subscribing to their Twitter feed to get the latest info on special events that are going on. Also, pin trading with the cast members is fun.",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

Disneyland has changed over the decades, gone are the days were you can show up during the week days and stroll around leisurely without crowds. I went on a Tuesday 4/30 on a value day and it was packed. I can truly see why they banned the wagon strollers as the pedestrian walk ways were very hard to navigate with the double strollers, wagons and mobility scooters, it was insane. The mobility scooters are very dangerous in crowds with the people on them driving like crazy to get to rides. You have to go there with a plan so that you can see as many attractions as you can and expect disappointments, my free ticket was a park hopper and my favorite ride in cars land broke down at 10 am and the line to get a fast pass was 4 blocks long, maybe next time. Negative stuff aside, Disneyland will still provide you with top of the notch attractions, shows, parades, clean restrooms, and ample parking. Arrive early and work that fastpass system.

On top of that you don't have to waste time running to each FastPass station to get passes for you and all your family.

5926,"It’s become very clear that Disney’s Leadership Team (DLT) does not understand the current customer experience at Disneyland.In an effort to be seen as both a Resort getaway for vacationers, and a single-day park experience for locals + annual pass holders, the park ends up being an overcrowded experience that disrespects both parties. The disrespect is felt in different ways, but ultimately it boils down to the same reason: People don’t feel like they are getting their money’s worth. I will focus on the experience from a vacationer’s point of view, as that was my most recent experience. Also, my breakdown will be focused on the parks, not the hotel (which was fantastic and exactly as advertised. A big thank you to the cast members at the Grand Californian for a wonderful stay).As a vacationer, the perk of “Magic Hour” felt wasted. By the time you finish getting through security lines and gate entry lines, you have about 30-40 minutes before the park ‘opens’. Well, sort of. Multiple rides, shops, and in some cases entire lands were closed until general admission at 9am. General admission was also given access to Main Street starting at 8:15 (my guess to allow for Rise of the Resistance boarding), which results in another line that requires you present magic hour credentials. So, what exactly was the benefit of this hour? To wait in a 30-50 minute line just to enjoy one ride before the larger crowds swarmed in. Then, the real day begins…For most of the day, about 75% of your time will be spent waiting in line: lines for attractions, lines for food, lines for the restroom, lines for characters, lines for shows etc. For example, we waited over an hour with FastPass Tickets just to get semi-decent viewing access to the World of Color show. Something we noted to the cast members, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears.What’s unfortunate, is the cast members have been given this incredibly difficult challenge of corralling enormous amounts of people without the proper support or infrastructure. As a result, the overall experience feels shortchanged. You are rushed through every segment of entertainment at a brisk pace by cast members so exhausted that they don’t even have the energy to smile through the pain, and the pace also robs you of any moment to just breath and take in the artistry that was signature to Disney’s “Magical” quality.The sad part? We were there for what is considered a “quiet” time of the year. I can’t imagine what’s it’s like to work there as cast member during normal or peak season. To the folks who work at Disneyland, I am so sorry that you have to deal with this nonsense on a daily basis. You are not paid enough and your Leaders have failed you and your org.Overall the experience was a major letdown. My fiancé and I had fun at certain moments, but a lot of our fun was in spite of the surrounding park experience, not because of it.The DLT needs to make a choice, because Disneyland will never have the size and scale of operation of Disneyworld to support both types of audiences. They need to either A) focus on catering to the single-day experience for locals, or B) cater to the resort stayers / multi-day hopper passes and eliminate single-day entry. Prices can be raised to accommodate for the loss of whichever audience type they are willing to forego. Either way, something needs to be done to reduce the capacity, so that the park can truly enjoyed by both cast members and customers alike. Until the DLT figure out what they want Disneyland to be, save your money and go to Disneyworld if you want the real experience of being at a Disney park.P.S. I hate ending things on a negative note, so I will say the highlight of the trip was Galaxy’s Edge. The land had the best food, unique merchandise and experiences, and two amazing attractions. RotR and Smuggler’s Run were the two best storytelling experiences that were so impressively done that even my non-star wars fan fiancé felt was fully immersed in the narrative.

For food, Install DisneyLand App on your phone so that you can order ahead without standing in the line.",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

5946,"Overall happy with my experience but I mainly gave it a one due to a situation in which I felt it was unfair. To get good seatings to watch the parade and fantasmic you must start reserving your seats on the sidewalk 1-2hrs in advance which means your unable to enjoy the rides or take pictures with characters so that you don’t lose your seats. Well I noticed that there was this section of seats that said reserved so I asked a cast member how can we get access to the seats. He went on to explain that normally you pay $7500 starting at $2500 for a tour to later find out that cast members were randomly choosing families to sit there. I asked a family who sat there how did they get access to reserve the seats and she said that they were just taking a picture with Mickey when a cast member asked if they were planning in watching the parade and we’re directed to sit there. Now I think that’s unfair. Families such as myself reserved our seat on the side walk an hr before, didn’t take any pictures with Mickey or we would lose our spot for another family who didn’t care to reserve their seats in advance because taking a picture with Mickey was more important and still be given the opportunity to sit on the reserved seatings, now that’s unfair for us who waited over an hour. I expressed my dissatisfaction to a cast member who did not show any signs of empathy or apologized for how we felt but instead said I was able to leave a review on their website. Disneyland need to stop doing that. It’s completely unfair and it is making a lot of dissatisfied customers who saw other families be randomly selected to sit in the reserved seating while we still sat on the side walk for over an hr.",1/5,3 years ago on  Google

I find that it is not overwhelming like the one in Orlando you can actually spend one day and see the whole park  which to me makes it worth it . I feel that the one in Florida is so big you have to spend a week there just to see everything . I wish I could spend more time at this place also since there is another Park  right outside of the Disneyland entrance you can spend half a day at One Park and half a day in the other Park  and we did and had a wonderful timeit was an amazing adventure and I would recommend that you take as many days as you can possibly spend as you won't regret the time you spend at Disney. I am sure I will go back to California and visit this park again as it is my favorite Park of all the Disneyland parks they also have the best Fastpass process out of all the other Parks you can get one every hour and you don't have to pay any extra for them which makes it that much more inviting.,5/5,4 years ago on  Google

We stayed for 10 hours and didn't even see all of the park due to the lines and crowds.It's also a lot dirtier than I remember. Considering that other modern day parks have plenty of free water available, I was also shocked at how rarely I sighted a water fountain, which has surely led to heat stroke for many attendees on a hot summer day.

5973,"Came here in early April with my family and had a great experience.  Crowds were reasonable, and all the rides were in working order.Here are some helpful hints that I've learned over our several visits over the years:* [Most important]  Find times when crowds are reduced.  The summer and major holidays can feel like bumper to bumper humanity, and it seems like you spend all your time waiting in lines at least 60-90 mins or more, and the magical experience doesn't feel ""magical.""  If you're going to spend the money to attend, then make sure you're enjoying the attractions and not just standing in long lines.* Learn about the fast pass programs before you go, and use frequently throughout your visit while they are available.  Well worth the effort.  We especially enjoy Toy Story (Midway) & Incredible Coaster on California Side and Space Mountain & Star Tours on Park side.  We're looking forward to the new Stars Wars attraction area when it opens mid-2019.* Wear comfortable walking shoes.  You're going to spend a long time walking from place to place and may be standing in lines from 20-60 mins generally.*We like bringing a small backpack and filling with a few bottled waters,  a light jacket or sweatshirt if the weather gets a little cool & also a pair of water shoes (flip flops).  This way our socks & nice walking shoes are not wet all day.  Reminder:  security won't allow selfie-sticks or unopened plastic bottles.*Bring a plastic bag for electronics (i.e. cell phones) if going on any water attraction.  (Hint:  Once when I forgot, I used the provided ice bag from the hotel which worked well.)*If you have small children, then strongly consider building in a nap during the early afternoon itinerary by intent - even if you need to have a grandparent assist in these efforts.  This way the children will be able to better appreciate the parades, fireworks, etc.  The rookie mistake is to go non-stop, and then they are exhausted by late afternoon and don't have the same appreciation for the events and activities as you'd wish they did.*We also enjoyed the musicals (Aladdin previously & now Frozen).  Broadway quality performances, and great theatre experience, which can be a nice change from just straight rides.*Over by the Haunted House and New Orleans train station is a small restaurant area where you can order Mickey Mouse shaped Beignets.  They are like a cross between a scone and a doughnut, but have become a favorite snack location for the kids at least once during our visit.*We like spending one day at the Disneyland Resort, one day in California Adventure, and the last day hopping between the two to enjoy our favorite rides one last time.  If you spend all 3 days park hopping, that can be a lot more walking than may be desired and may actually diminish the enjoyment of the overall experience.  3 days seems to be a really good balance.  Obviously, 3 days needs to be within the budget, but is a nice length of stay.*Be kind.  People attend the parks from all over the country and even the world.  Use the time standing in lines to get to know the people around you and gain an appreciation for their backgrounds and/or cultures.  Make it a friendly, small world indeed!",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

I didn't give it 5 stars because it is expensive compared to other theme parks and that will continue, but I feel I have more options and things to explore and do here than at other theme parks.  I recommend getting multi day passes or annual passes if you can afford it so you get more value for your money.

Despite the cold/rainy weather, we got to see most of the characters during the breaks in the rain. We also got a glimpse of some of the really wacky people that stalk the characters. When I say wacky I mean downright disturbing. It deepened my respect for those that work as princesses to be able to maintain their composure with individuals who are clearly pretty delusional about their supposed closeness to the characters, and continue to interact with guests after those disturbing encounters.Had several really good experiences with using the app to order ahead when we were ready to eat, and one really bad one in California adventure when I probably could have gone through the line 3 times in the time it took them to prepare my order after I checked in.In all my times going to Disneyland, it feels like they place their “A level” employees in Disneyland, and the ones that haven’t quite grasped the Disney cheerfulness (or those having a bad day) in California Adventure.

The park overall is iconic and is a tradition so to speak. I hope that somehow they are able to enhance the park to accommodate larger crowds as it is obviously a popular spot.

6086,"After waiting 30 years to finally make it to this park I was wo disappointed. Way too many people with no sense of walking direction and completely oblivious to other people walking around them. Extremely disappointing rides with ridiculous wait times. And even with the fast pass you can only reserve a fast past every hour and half with the best rides having such a limited amount that they become unavailable quickly. Even with the fast pass the wait is ridiculous.  Of all the Disney characters we only saw 4 or 5 in the 13 hours we were there! The Castle is small and the majority of the rides aren't handicap accessible and they are sit through rides with  creepy puppets and wax figures. Even Space Mountain is disappointing. The Haunted Mansion has one of the longest wait times and it isn't scary. Just a ride through with Nightmare before Christmas characters.  Might be worth it for a 4 or 5 year old but will they remember it? Even my 7 year old girl was disappointed... didn't feel magical at all! Disney Adventure is way better and if you are looking for thrill rides, go to Knox Berry Farms! Cheaper better and way less people and waiting!",2/5,4 years ago on  Google
6087,"The park is OK.  However, a really nasty interaction with the security guard at the entrance ruined the whole visit for me.  The man threatened to ban me permanently for not knowing I could not bring a selfie stick with me.  After that interaction, had I been by myself I would have honestly left and never came back.  Unfortunately, I was with my family after traveling from another country, so that was not an option.  This initial contact soured the whole experience.  Would not go again, did not feel welcome.",1/5,3 years ago on  Google
6088,"Great place for kids. Can be crowded during peak months. Great for all ages. There are many secrets to the park if you find a cast member for help, or explore on your own. There are many changes coming. A current change is the evening parade and firework show due to the current PixarFest. Buzz Lightyear flies high over the castle unlike in the past when it was Tinkerbell. The current redo of Pirates is worth a trip, and I suggest if you are staying all day to bring snacks. The park allows you to do so, and you can also bring in water. In addition, I would suggest walking to Disney from the parking structure instead of waiting on the tram. It is not a long walk, and it is worth not having to wait. If you are interested in any shows or parades I would either get a map, download the app, or as a cast member. There are many different food options within the park. My favorite is the cafe with the pink umbrellas they have the best variety, and the best dessert options. They have a raspberry macaroon that is to die for!! They change the desserts in their display, but this is one you need to try!",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

6098,"This was a special girls trip with my bestie to celebrate her birthday! I hadn't been to visit in 6 years and it felt so good to be back!We stopped in City Hall to talk about disability accommodations. I have a hard time standing on my feet for long periods of time and walking a lot. I knew from previous visits that Disneyland has accommodations for disabled and special needs kids. For certain rides, you use a special entrance (usually the exit) and a cast member works you into the regular line or gives you a time to return. Unfortunately, I was met with a cast member that didn't embody the Disney way and refused to help me. (I don't look disabled, which shouldn't matter anyway)* After being refused. We decided to hit the park anyway. I ended up renting a scooter at the Disneyland hotel. Totally worth it.The park wasn't super crowded considering it was mid-August. It was super hot, though and rather smokey due to the fires.We had 3 day passes with park hopper and max pass. The max pass gets you unlimited pics from the Disneyland photographers. That was totally worth the cost. You download the app and get your QR code that the photographer scans after taking your pictures. I screenshot the code so I could easily find it and didn't have to open the app every time. The app also gave us the wait times for rides and we were able to make some plans.My friend is gluten free and while there are tons of gluten-free options in the park, the app doesn't show those options on the menu. What you need to do is ask at each restaurant when ordering and then they let you know what you can order. The options were super yummy and never repeated which was fantastic, they really are progressive when it comes to options.My only sadness, many of the cast-members were cranky and it was very un Disney like. It was such a fantastic trip!The castle was closed throughout the day for shows and parades and as usual people started lining up hours before the parades which made it difficult to grab space but great for riding the popular rides.Several of the rides still have single rider lines so as long as you don't mind separating your party this is a perfect option to hop on a ride with a long ride.",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

6103,"I can't believe only 2 reviews before me.  This place has been around for many years, and has visitors from all over the world.  I have been there half a dozen times.  Previous experiences have been good, but not good this time.  Don't get me wrong, its an amazing place, but the experience was bitter at times.  The prices have gone into the highway robbery category.  We paid $265 per person for a 3 day pass, and there were 8 of us.  They do not track tickets as well as they claim, because it took them 45 minutes at the ticket booth to print our tickets purchase online.  The Hotel (Disneyland's own hotel) could not help us with our ticket (they have a ticket specialist on staff).  The rides were fun, but the lines were long.  You would think at $265, you would not have to stand in line for very long.  It takes 3 days now to see the two parks, because the rides close at certain times of the day and sometimes for the whole day.  Disney put in this fireworks thing at night, its really well done, but I have a feeling it was done just to shut down part of the park and save more than they spend on the fireworks.  Let me tell you about the special shows...  Like Fantasmic, World of Color, and the Disney Parades.  To watch them you have to kill at least one and a half hours of your day holding a spot where you can see anything.  Even when you get a ticket (Fast pass) to world of color you have to be there one hour before they start.  Just before the shows start, the ""Human Animals"" come out they push in front of you,...  you feel like you are guarding your territory, and that is when the profanities come out.  Yes, people yelling at others, that is my spot, this was my child's spot, I am saving this spot for my family, !@#$%^&*.  Wow.  Profanity at Disneyland, terrible.  And what is it with the smell of sewer gas all over the park?  Anyways, we are not going back soon.

Basically, I left California Adventures at 7:30pm to grab some stuff out of my car I had my keys to get IN MY CAR, when I returned to the park it was 8:20pm and California Adventures was closed (8pm), so I went and enjoyed the rest of my time at Disney Land. We went to leave and I realized I lost my car keys, the bus operators and security said they were found on the bus and taken to the lost and found at Disney Land. I went and the girl there was SO rude. She didn't look and just stated she didn't have them, when I told her that everyone reported that she did, she finally decided to get up and do her job, she said they were locked at California Adventures and they were turned in at 8:30pm and found at California Adventures, when I told her that she was lying because, Alexis the bus operator, found them on the bus and I had them when I went back to my car at 7:30pm and when I came back California Adventures was already closed! She then said that she would MAIL my keys back to me! When I asked to speak to her Supervisor she said "" She is just going to tell you the same thing!"" GIRL let her ! So finally after I went and got the Secuirty Supervisor who was AMAZING, and if it wasn't for him I would have been left out in the cold by this employee, the Lost and Found Manager and another Manager they finally went and got my keys that she claimed she didn't have and couldn't get. So a big THANK YOU SO MUCH to Mr. Wayde for the help I cannot tell you how much it was appreciated. If you offer park Hooper tickets...and one park closes earlier than the other....wouldn't you just have one lost and found? OR transfer the lost items to the lost and found that's open later OR give the damn lost and found manager that stays later access to the other one?!

6121,"I spent 2 days in Disneyland in Late January and it was such a blast! Here are a few things I took away from our trip:- If you want to ride all of the rides GET THE MAX PASS! For 15 dollars a day we got to ride just about every single big ride and some more than once! (We rode the thunder montain ride 5 times). The wait in line with the pass was between 5-20 minuted which is world better than over an hour. Also, you have the convience of doing it from your phone rather than having to do to find the fastpass machine each time. We set timers so that we could get a new pass as soon as the wait was over (there is a small waiting period in between getting passes).-Bring an ice box because food is expensive and not the best thing we've had. We brought a small ice box that fix on the back of a stroller and we fit enough to feed 5 people a few times a day and SNACKS!-BRING A WATER BOTTLE! There are plenty of water fountains to refill throughout the day too.-I would recommend trying to get through each land as you go to avoid having to walk across the park again and again and again. (Good walking shoes is a must).-**READ** Splash mountain is more like dunk mountain. I LOVE the ride, but forgot how soaked you get and re rode it in the evening and we were chilly and damp until we got home!-For small kids who are interested in the princesses there was a small little cottege like area where there is a little meet and greet which was adorable!I could write more and more, but we had a blast and I am sure you will too!!",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

However this place is way too crowded and small and has some bad crowds in it walking around. When teenagers can just be dropped off like a mall at night a do stupid stuff and push each other around in line that’s ridiculous. The fast pass here doesn’t mean jack because you can only book one ride at a time and that ride could be at night. In Orlando you can book up to three! Awful system. I had the Max Pass and it is a major ripoff as the characters only come out for a few minutes at a time and some guy comes over and tells you get lost this is where the lines ends and your cut off. This happened several times. Outrageous prices. And there was an earthquake today too boot to close everything down. No refunds. I’ll never go again to Disneyland. Total ghetto dump.

I wasn't going to be able to stay late for the parade so I took advantage of the extra time to ride a few. The park can be difficult to navigate, especially when it's only your second time there but the rides I found were exactly how I remembered them. I was surprised how vividly I remembered them. Unfortunately the one ride I absolutely didn't want to miss had a 75 minute wait time, and as I went back a little later after waiting 50 minutes for star tours and another 35 minutes for snow white- I went back to Space Mountain and it was closed until 1030 pm. It was closed for over 5 hours! Missed out on that one. Didn't get the park hopper because I'd only be there for a short time. I did find the rose gold ears though.

6153,"Being a big fan of Star Wars, and as someone who grew up with the franchise, I primarily went there for Galaxy's Edge and Star Tours, before the parks had to shut down because of covid-19.At the time, a big negative was the crowds (I didn't get to try everything, because of the queues, and the people with me wanting to spend their time on other attractions, rather than waiting in line).Another issue for me, personally, was the focus on the latest trilogy, when it came to the Star Wars attractions. I believe that if they'd instead based the attractions in Galaxy's Edge on the original trilogy, it would have made the experience subjectively superior. The set and environment was excellent, but I missed my favorite characters, and would have rather seen older ship designs. Also, and while it makes things more immersive, the signage was confusing. I'd recommend using an app for aurebesh, or a decoder ring (I didn't think to do either), for anyone going.As for the rest of the park, it is the usual Disney fare - very artificial, but still a lot of fun to be had.

I had an encounter at the front gate with the security personnel when they interrogated me about a spent pistol shell that was pushed through a lanyard for looks (basically looking like a brass tube in the middle of some cordage), and they started nitpicking my keys, while misaccusing me of what some things were. I talked to their manager and they said that I was almost forced to take it off my keys because they ""didn't want that kind of image in their park"", yet those kinds of ""images"" are spread through almost the entire park with the shooting gallery in frontier land, or the shotguns and pistols in adventure land.

I found out that you couldn't take your stroller into the fast pass area of fantasmic, by this time both little kids are sound asleep so I don't want to pick them up and take them out. My father who needs a scooter and eldest son wanted to stay so I wad trying to find out where they were going to enter and asked a cast member. She pointed us to another cast member who would scan in the pass. Then she looks at the stroller and says I can't bring it in. I said yes I understand it's not going. Then she stared at me and asked if it had a blue tag or something. I said no, so she said well then it cant come in. Im like yes I know it's not going. So she repeats herself like 2 more times and as im walking away she's like ""yea well, I told you it's not going"".

The employees were less than gracious and condescending.  I was told I'd have to wait for the ride to break down or the park to close (at midnight!!) to retrieve my purse which contained all my cash, sunscreen (it was HOT!) ID, and car keys.  I was told I'd have to just keep checking the app to see when the ride goes down and come get my belongings.  When I asked what I do when the battery on my phone dies and I can't keep checking I was told to go buy a portable charge....with what money?!?!  I had nothing!  Ride shut down briefly at 7:30 p.m., no sweep for belongings was done even though I'd been back to the ride several times asking for help getting my purse back.  They don't care!  After being told by several different employees that I could retrieve my purse from them - they tell me at 10 p.m. they misinformed me and I have to get it from the Lost and Found.  Asked what time they get people's belongings to Lost and Found if the park closes at 12 - 12:45 a.m. is when it will be there!  Asked if they could be more accommodating since all their workers have told me I could get it from them - nope!  They do not care!  We were so tired and had been on every ride and decided to sit on the steps right next to the ride and wait till 12 a.m..  We were told we had to move because they ""occasionally"" use the steps!  Really!?  After the crew switched out....another family sat on the same steps and were never told to move.  Went to Lost and Found at 12 once park closed and sure enough...my purse did not show up till 12:45 a.m!  We were in shorts/tanks and by this time it was freezing outside - we had NOT planned on still being there!!  This was during the week and we all had to work the following day.  They offered for me to come back the next day and get it or they would mail it to me at no charge - we had no way to get home w/out my car keys and the other girls I was with also had their car keys in my car.  Didn't get home till 1:30 a.m.  Almost 15 hours at that place was FAR longer than I'd planned on being there and felt like a prisoner!  We had gone on the ride a 2nd time at 10 p.m. to see if we could see my purse and saw like 3 or 4 other bags as well!  Obviously this is an issue!Disneyland people:  Either install something on that damn ride on each end of the floorboard to prevent peoples belongings from sliding off that DON'T FIT IN YOUR POUCH,  redo your video to be MORE CLEAR on personal belongings and MENTION THE HOOK BECAUSE YOU LEFT THAT OUT and I didn't even see it... OR change your damn policy regarding retrieving people's belongings!!!!  Or how about this...the guy who checks seatbelts....if he sees someone's bag not secured properly, how about a heads up!?  How can you be OK with people paying an arm and a leg to get in to your park and then NOT be MORE accommodating when something is flung from your ride?!

Of course for their workers they do but forget their guests. Rudest people ever and to top off when we returned to car our hubcap was stolen.

Why should anyone pay a bunch of money on a family trip to just stand around for so long in a cramped and rude atmosphere? If I want that treatment I'll go to Rome in July. Not that I bothered waiting in a line that long but I watched the queues all day in the park app. I really think that Disneyland closes down the rides as a method of dispersing the line so a new line later can form. Rides seemed to ""break down"" left and right. Family spent three days just at Disneyland park only and still didn't get to do everything we wanted to do which is lame and we stayed until Midnight all three nights. The first ride we went on was Peter Pan and it sucked so hard because the lights on the floor were all out. The ride clearly was getting worked on but instead of closing it they let people wait 35 minutes for a ride where most of it was too dark to see anything. And 35 minutes was the short wait. People are rude and the staff isn't friendly as they once were, to the point I spent the trip making references to the third Reich. I think they were stressed about the opening of Star Wars land and it showed. What I really hate is when you walk up to a worker standing around at the ride to ask a question and they are in the middle of a conversation and stand there talking like you don't exist. It does not feel like the Happiest Place on Earth but a place where you are shoved from one crowd of a holes to the next while being told every which way you are somehow standing in line wrong or you can't turn your head on a ride.  Disneyland seriously needs to get rid of the Southern California discount pass and needs a new system of crowd control. Maybe the whole park should get a reservation system. I almost got knocked over trying to get a seat for the Mickey Magical Map show. People rushed the stage like it was a rock concert and I was holding a toddler. I was waiting to try and get a picture with Minnie and literally got shoved out of line by a family who just ran up like there wasn't a line.

6216,This place is highly overrated and fast pass is a joke. Every time we got in line to meet the character's..as soon as we got close..they took a break and to wait 65 minutes is a joke.

It's a small world-closed, the matterhorn-closed, the fireworks were cancelled half way through and space mountain was closed for over 2 hours. With the money we paid to get into a park like this they should at least make sure the rides and events that are going on are opened. We went on a Friday. So especially on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday. If any repairs or decorating happens it should be on a weekday that doesn't effect the weekends. Also when we purchased our tickets at the ticket both our friend whom was an adult as well they have him a child's ticket. We paid for 3 adult tickets. We didn't realize they did that till we had to have it scanned. They were going to make us go back in the long ticket line to change it till we asked to speak to a manager. Then they approved of it.

6226,"My husband and I decided to have a fun getaway and fly out to Disneyland. We saved our money decided to get a two day pass, which was almost $500.00. The first day we got on a whole 4 rides, we waited in line over 90 minutes on each ride. Tried doing the fast pass and it said to come back like 5 hours later? So we went over to California Adventure watched a light show and thought we would hit the rides there after the show.  Only to find the park closed. So walk back over to Disney land and the lines were worse. We kept bumping into people got ran over by angry moms with baby strollers can’t blame them. Wheel chairs   It was horrible. So we called it a night. Came back to California adventure first thing in the morning and got on one ride. By the time we got off the ride, did the fast pass on another ride   Walked back over to Disney the wait was 90 minutes again. Isn’t there a fire law against this cramming people into one place. Omg if something happened there you would get trampled on.  It was such a bad experience. We were so disappointed, we spent a lot of money to ride maybe a total of 8 rides in two days.   Can’t say we will do that again anytime soon!",2/5,5 years ago on  Google

6228,"Awful experience with rude staffFrom the start, the visit was marred with malfunctioning systems and unhelpful staff. Our first set of fast passes were acquired at 8:25. We shortly realized they were printed as “invalid” we were then instructed to return to the main entrance to have our entrance passes validated. After that every entrance with a fast pass to a ride was marred with failures in the system, confusion and occasional suspicious treatment from the staff. Eventually the staff would “fix” the system and let us in. The day concluded with me eventually trying to enter Incredicoaster with a valid fast pass that I had obtained 2 hours earlier. Because it wasn’t matched with my main pass (I was holding my wife’s and she was on the other side of the park with my son - I had no idea it was my wife’s pass before this point). I was refused entrance. When I explained the situation I was told there was nothing they could do (by a very unhelpful Vanessa) and was accused of finding my pass on the floor by ‘Michael’ who proceeded to treat me like a liar and a fraudster. Eventually, he took me to a park service agent who eventually found my purchase in the system and transferred the fast pass between the cards. Why they had to waste my time in the blazing sun for half an hour and call me a liar is beyond me. I’m not that desperate or petty to try to bluff my way into a god amen theme park ride.I spent over $1400 to bring 2 families to Disneyland. I expect better than being treated like a common criminal.

It was easy to walk past and not see an attraction. At night the streets were too dark to navigate and find attractions. I get that we need dark for parade, Mickeys show and fireworks but couldnt some lights go off just during the shows.The map should be more detailed and provided in a digital format. Souveniers were way too expensive. $30 for MM headband is too much. The average family has to save just for entry and their special gifts are financially out of reach. Sure the rides are free once you are in the gate but why dont the kids get vouchers to use for a food treat or face painting etc...

And also the same more or less to get back to your car. I believe the water fountains should have a bottle filling option to help reduce plastic bottles and encourage people to bring their own reusable water bottles. Food options are mainly junk food, we need more healthy options.  Parents switch is ridiculous, their system is basically you have to wait twice, once for the 1st parent and the 2nd through fast pass, which increase your wait time about 20 min.The 2nd park was worst because they ran out of pass half day so we could only use it twice that day.",3/5,3 years ago on  Google

Avoid days when all passes are open, even during off-peak school days. On a recent visit, when all but the most expensive passes were blocked, the crowds were low, and wait times were very low.

6292,I spent a lot of money to go to Disneyland to make a memorable visit for my almost 13 year old daughter who had never been. We were there one day. The one thing my daughter wanted to do was get a autograph and photo with Aladdin and Jasmine. The man working the line prior to their visit with Aura had told me I did not have to be there between 4:05 and 4:10 exactly because they would be there for about a 1/2 an hour. While waiting for Aladdin we waited in line for Tinkerbell for the longest time after they switched out the Tinkerbell the line finally started moving. We got to Aladdin and Jasmine's line at exactly 4:11 and the lady told me we could not get in. I explained to her what the gentlemen had said and this was the only thing my daughter had wanted. She told me no and was very rude. Unbelievable for the cost of this park and the fact that they could not keep the line open for an extra minute after an previous employee had told me we would be fine and did not need to be there at the exact time.  There should have been another time during the day for them to appear. I work very hard to support my daughter and this vacation did cost me a lot of money as we are from Colorado.,3/5,4 years ago on  Google

But it's something that you should do at least a couple times in your life.We decided to get the cheap annual passes but my complaint with that is that they no longer allow you to buy a parking pass.

In the future we will definitely maximize our time there (and our value) by making sure that we do the full 4-day pass. There is just far too much to absorb in one single day.As a family with small children (13, 8 and 5), one thing that we did that was particularly helpful was  I informed them that they would not be allowed to purchase anything as far as a souvenir was concerned during the day that we spent in Disneyland.

Yes, we were told at the gate that the park would be open until 6pm. We were charged full day fare of almost $400 for four people (not pocket change!!!). We were not told that we would actually be shoved out at 4pm. We were not told that there would be no fireworks. This was the only thing we wanted to see for sure, and had been told to stand on Main Street watching the castle for best view of that... so your custimer service telling us that well you had some rides (after considerable waits) and all this info was supposedly on your website is just poor customer service. Oh and tickets to after 4pm on May 22 with a very clear warning that we will not get in as the park will have reached maximum capacity by then and everyone would want to stay to see the fireworks... what kind of a lame ""compensation"" is that???

6340,I have an annual pass and go at least once or twice a month and I can tell you it never gets old. To do everything in one area of the park it takes at least half a day. This is the best place to take your kids and let your inner child shine through. This is the best place for a day out with your family or a week of fun. The best hotel is the Disneyland Hotel. It is walking distance from Downtown Disney and the rest of the park and has the best restaurants. It also has Goofy's Kitchen which is the only and best buffet in the whole Disney area. You can either do breakfast or dinner. Both has amazing food and the best experience. It is a character restaurant which means there are tons of characters that come around to all tables. It is a most do especially if you are visiting from very far away and won't visit that often because this is a once in a life time experience especially if you are celebrating a birthday. There are always tons of people with birthdays there so it is fun. Everybody is so lively and for the adults they serve alcohol beverages. For the kids they have tons of things that kids will enjoy. From mac and cheese to pizza.The best ride in the park is Big Thunder Mountain for the older kids and It's A Small World for the younger kids. Big Thunder Mountain is a fast pace roller coaster that goes through old western mountains with a cave and at the end you race out of a mountain that is about to explode. It's A Small World is a slow pace boat ride where you explore different cultures. It is not that fun for the older kids because most think that it is too slow.This is my view on Disneyland.

6360,"I have been coming to Disneyland every year since I was a kid and its always been where some of my best memories are made.  During my most recent visit I noticed that not all cast members are exuding the same magic and excitement as they always have.  Upon my first entry into the park on my 5 day park hopper ticket one of the ticket takers made a comment of why they've banned double wides (I have a side by side double stroller) because per her they didn't have those back in the 50s when the park was made which is why it's tough to get the stroller thru the gate.  This comment was made after I had a bit of trouble getting thru the gate past their stools.  If these strollers have been banned then tell me I can't bring my stroller in.  They aren't enforcing this new rule because not only did I see other strollers like mine but wagons as well.  I spent way too much money on my visit to be talked smart to like that so Disney pay your people more so they aren't annoyed at guests or remind them of the ""magic"" they are to bring to every guests experience.The max pass also went up from $10 last year to $15 this year which is a bit excessive especially when some of the rides you cant request a fast pass for like the Star Wars ride.  I also noticed that they did not place photo takers at character experiences that I believe they should have.  For example Mickey and Minnie were together near the front gate in their Halloween costumes they did not have a photographer with them yet there were 3 for the line to take your pic in front of the flowers/train/sign at the front of the park there right beyond the gates.  When I asked the handler why this was he said the computer didn't recognize that Mickey and Minnie would be there together.  I dont believe that for a second since everything at Disney is run like a well oiled machine.

The new areas like Star Wars Land is fun, but the old stuff is outdated and not worth the small amount of enjoyment in reminiscing on the good old days. Their prices keep going up and sadly many will continue to pay for not a lot in return. After visiting Disney World last year, I think that's where we'll invest our money whenever we decide to visit again.

Then the rides started to be shut down right around 12:50 until about 2 then they got shut down again. We went in for a refund and we had to wait an hour in a half in 111 degree weather for a refund. After they gave us a refund they escorted us out of the park. This was a very bad experience as we were visiting from Oklahoma and it was my birthday.

Also, it was my 3rd time ever being there.I will share some basic information I was able to learn over a three day weekend.  he app was great for a GPS map of where I was and how i can get to the next ride in the fastest direction. It also tells you the wait times of all the rides.for new people that have never been.1. Download the Disneyland App. It will show you a map of the Park with GPS. It will also show you all the rides wait times. I heard you can get Fastpasses through the app but there is an extra fee of $15.00 per. You can also order food from specific food vendors and you dont have to wait in the long lines.2. Go early if you want a chance to ride a specific ride you've been looking forward too. But don't fret, the lines really don't take that long to get through.3. If you don't mind possibly splitting up from your group. Take the single person lane, with your group. You may get separated but at least you're not waiting 1.5 hours to ride a 5 min. ride. Most of the time you will get to ride with some of your group.4. Try Fastpass. Just know from what I was told from a park employee. You can only get a Fastpass for a ride once for every two hours. So you cannot go around ride to ride and just get fast passes.5. The Starwars New Area. Very overated. Don't get me wrong, its still awsome! There is only one ride. I want to say it's less than 10 min. long, maybe 5 minutes. It is the only place in Disneyland to get an Adult Beverage. Take note, this being said, you cannot get a alcoholic beverage unless you have a reservation and currently reservations are two weeks out. So if this is something you really need to fo to. Make your reservation first then buy you Park Pass for that day. Oh, be ready to wait in line even though you have a reservation and the drinks will cost you an arm and leg.The little city has tons of specialty shops for memorabilia. You can build your own R2-D2/BB-8 for $99.99 or you can build you own light saber for $199.00.The above were just some quick and simple observations I thought I would pass on to the newly or never been.Good Luck!",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

You wait in line for hours, and the only reparation being a ride which Disney gives itself too much credit for, assuming their three minute ride makes up for the large chunk of your day you lose waiting for it. The fast passes have turned into a joke, where now if you don't pay the extra money on top of your ticket, you go into the ""stand-by"" lines which are the equivalent of the slums as desperate people crowd, cut, and cheat their way through the feature film length waiting times. However it's not like it used to be, because now, fast passes fill up by 1pm so there is little luck nowadays in riding one or more of the big rides such as Space Mountain, or Indie, without waiting multiple hours or paying extra money. Every chance Mickey can market his ""diamond package/annual passes"" is heavily capitalised on and you pay the price with your comfort and valuable time as they wave ""what you could have,"" in your face if you spent the extra money. Their food and menu items are a joke, as they blatantly lie about items, going as far as charging 83 dollars for a breakfast of three which was a parfait, scoop and serve biscuits and gravy, and microwave pancakes. Another example, their 30$ ""short ribs"" were actually just a small peice of pot roast.   I've been going to Disney since the 90's and this will be my last visit, for sure.

Customers bring in the check. She needs to learn how to treat the guests. When the ride was over she was laughing at me with another  employee. My daughter who's 4 even told me that she was mean and ugly. I will keep calling about her to complain til they fix the situation. Also the employees that sweep are rude too. One that was sweeping on main Street was rude as well. Not my fault she works like a slave. Maybe she should get a another job so she stops being so miserable. Disney doesn't feel like it use to anymore. They need to step up their game. Overrated. Rude employees make the place look bad. Some employees are nice but some shouldn't even be there.",2/5,3 years ago on  Google

6522,"I was there yesterday and although this isn't my first time going to Disneyland, they often are keeping it updated and clean as ever. I really appreciate that they keep such a great standard for guest service and cleanliness, which I have noticed other theme parks have often let go after a few years. I was able to ride the new Starwars Rise Of The Resistance in the Galaxys edge portion of the park, and I highly recommend trying to obtain a boarding pass, which are available to guests through the Disneyland app when the park officially opens at it's published open time (not the early magic hour) that Disneyland has predetermined and is available for view also on the app, it is also key to note that you must be in the park and have your ticket scanned with your entire party in order to receive a boarding pass exactly at published time. So if the park opens at 8am be in the park with your ticket scanned in before then ( I suggest anywhere from 7-7:50, or whenever the employees let you in) and also refresh your Disneyland app at 8am or open it exactly at 8 and join a boarding pass then. I hope it works out for you, but either way I highly recommend visiting the new addition Galaxys edge at Disneyland.",5/5,2 years ago on  Google

6555,"I'm a 48-yr old male, grew up in CA and have visited Disneyland my whole life. I've lived out of state for some time but it has not stopped me from visiting the parks and staying in its resorts, and when I do visit I make it a mission to take someone who has never been (adult or child, family or friend). . My complaint and sad story is that on my son's 2nd birthday, 12/11/2018, my son and I visited The Baby Care Center on Main Street so that I could change my son, as well as warm his milk and hopefully find a place for us to sit so he could take a short nap.We entered the building and there were two elderly women employees (grandmother looking) sitting in rocking chairs next to another. I advised both of my mission, the women advised me that the private rooms were full, but I could still access any sitting areas and use microwave in back room/kitchen to warm the milk/bottles (neither lady ever got up from her chair to help/assist me or offered assistance.)I was in backroom literally minutes (because my son's milk was still warming in microwave) when another man, very friendly, entered and began unpacking a bag. He was joking with me about the duties of being a Dad when one of the elderly lady employees entered and interrupted us  questioning me if I was done with the microwave because the man needed it for his bottles. The man interjected and nicely told the lady that he was not in a rush and that she should allow me to finish using the microwave, and added he first needed to wash his bottles anyway.This same lady then offered the man that if he should need anything do not hesitate to ask, and during her leaving kitchen area she advised him that if I were to be in his way he should let her know.The man explained to the lady how we knew what we were doing and assured her that he wouldn't require her assistance.After she left, the man (who at no fault to me) actually apologized to me for her (the employee) and politely told me and my son to take as much my time as we needed. .My COMPLAINT is that out of my 48yrs of life I would never have expected Disneyland to be a place in my lifetime where I would feel most insulted and prejudiced against, especially with my son at my side.I am a Hispanic male, and a disabled combat Veteran. The friendly man/father is white skinned, the two elderly employees are one being white skinned and the other brown skinned. The employee to insult and embarrass me and my son was the white skinned female employee who got up from her chair without being asked to help the white skinned father.I never thought I would have to share a story like this, but I feel it's my duty to warn others and be wary upon entering The Baby Care Center on Main Street.As for me and my family & friends, Disneyland or its affiliate vacation destinations are no longer any of our vacation destinations, and we contacted the Huggies CEO and Board Members of our experience.

Make your way to all the main attractions as soon as you get in the park. There will be almost no wait. You can knock out 4-5 rides the first 2 hours this way. Get fast passes for rides that will have a long wait time early. Another great time to ride attractions are during parades. I'm not a parade fan, but parents and their children are so the lines decrease dramatically during that time.  People who complain about the line waits arent doing Disney correctly.

6559,"We planned to be in the park for 3 days. We spent two days in Disneyland and one day in California adventure and that was plenty for our family.Disneyland is a beautiful and timeless theme park. I have good memories of this park as a youth. I enjoyed taking my kids here, but I don't expect to return for many years.Disneyland has changed over the years, some in good ways, others not so good. The amount of visitors the park receives daily is insane. We were supposed to be in the park on one of the least busy days of the year (April, middle of week, not a holiday), but it was still busy and we heard it was unusually busy. Wait time without a FastPass was ridiculously long, since without a fast pass we figured we would have been able to ride only 8-10 rides a day. The congestion and wait times at the park is my reason for the 4 star rating.The good is the rides they provide are still amazing and worth visiting the park. I was sad Pirates of the Caribbean was closed while we were there since this  is one of my favorite rides, though I believe it is open again as of the time I'm writing this review.Go to the rides you want to ride as soon as the park opens. I wouldn't go to the park without a fast pass if you can afford it and it was well worth using the Disneyland app to do this so you didn't have to run all over the park to sign up for a fast pass for a specific ride.We took our own food into the park, since cost of food in the park is very expensive (I'd say double what you'd pay outside the gates). We did eat at the Hungry Bear to get a burger and they were good, just not great burgers.California adventure major ride wait times were crazy (2+ hours for Cars), so we didn't make it to Cars and the Pixar pier and rollercoaster were closed, so we didn't think California Adventure was all that great. The rides we were able to ride were amazing and we really enjoyed the National park section of California Adventure (zip line, towers, etc.).Indiana Jones has great potential, but we thought it was too fast. I know it is a ride, but there is so much going on, I think I would have preferred it be more of a tourist ride than the fast jerky escape type ride. I did like how the line was part of the experience.Star tours is amazing and this is in our top 3 rides we liked and rode as many times as we could.Big thunder mountain is also in the top 3 and hope this coaster sticks around for people to enjoy for years to come.Guardians of the Galaxy is in the top 3 and worth riding as many times as you can.

6594,"What more can be said about Disneyland? It really is the happiest place on earth. We took our 7 year old for his first time on a 5 day park pass, no hopper (which I'd absolutely recommend getting). The entire cast and crew are so meticulously trained in making every single guest feel wonderful. Not a single employee is ever doing anything but smiling, they're always happy and willing to direct you anywhere you want to go, answer every question you have for them. It seems they take so much pride in their jobs. On our 4th day, he had a bit of a tantrum, and lo and behold, one of the cast members took immediate notice, a member of their fun police came up, had a 10 minute conversation with him, making him laugh, making him feel like a grown up, and cheering him right up. I wish I could commend every cast member there as this is my wife and I's third trip, and sons first, and it never gets less magical. There is always something to do no matter where you are, or what ride you're waiting for, the fast passes work great, and the Disney wait times app was a life saver. The fireworks, electric parade and water show are all wonderful ways to end the night. I can only hope every kid, or kid at heart has the opportunity to experience this place at least once in their lives. My only gripe is that the food is quite expensive, but it's all part of the experience and we wanted it to be as magical as possible for our boy. He loved the churros and thought the friend turkey legs were hilarious and delicious. Bring a camel pack or plenty of water, it'll save you 4 dollars a bottle and it gets hot,  even security to get into the main park area were friendly and joking around with everyone, or doing random Disneyland trivia while people waited in line. I could go on, but please, see for yourself how incredible this place is. It's worth every penny to create memories that will last a lifetime for those both young and old.10/10, will return once new star wars land is complete. Oh, one Last thing.

Fastpass is worth it, we were able to hit almost all the rides in one day, we did do the three day passes though, and that took a lot of the burden and rush off of our experience. There is plenty of time with the three day pass.Get the phone app to make it all easier, and take advantage of photopass if you get the fast pass. The big characters do meet and greets on the street, in the plaza at the entrance each evening. It makes it easy to get that picture with Mickey.Food prices aren't too bad, but it's also just as easy to walk out the front gate and visit one of the many restaurants that are within walking distance.We missed the Star Wars area opening by a couple of weeks, but the cast members were doing walkabout in the park and were pretty cool to see.The mix of old ""Legacy"" rides and new rides kept things fun too. We hit the legacy rides during our magic hour and were able to get Pinocchio, Mr. Toad, Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland done in that hour, while we waited for our Matterhorn fastpass.We also did California Adventure park. That was not such a great value, it looks like Disney is spending a lot of money to build it up for their other movie franchises (Marvel and Pixar) there were cool construction barriers that said Stark Industries on them which hopefully means more Marvel type rides. When done it should be pretty nice but for right now there are only a few rides worth going for. Honestly though, they are pretty good rides. The Guardians of the Galaxy ride was fun, but two out of three of its ride platforms were down while we were there. This made fastpass all that much more advantageous, what turned into a two hour plus wait for the normal line stayed relatively acceptable with the fastpass. To be fair though the second lift didn't break down until we were already almost done waiting in the fastpass line.

The people in costume are very good at their jobs and it’s nice to see them play along with the children (and adults). Everything is overpriced, but WAY overpriced.

It was $1 more for Cheetos, it’s not an upgrade going from Lays to Cheetos. It’s an upgrade going from Granny Goose to Cheetos.

No amusement park on earth pays such close attention to detail or keeps it's park as clean and orderly as Disney. I can visit the park several times a month and always find something to do and keep me entertained. Plus, Disneyland is always changing. Recently, they've refurbished the Matterhorn Bobsled ride, adding new special effects, and at the Haunted Mansion, added a much talked about original piece back to the ride, the Hatbox Ghost.

Bibbity bobbity beauty boutique was closed also for some renovations starting after we took our daughter there. All the rides seemed to be well taken care of dont know if it was mild maintenance or the rides where legitemitaly braking down sometimes 2 or 3 rides would be down at a time. The fast pass that I knew is no more now you have to buy what they call a max pass and that's extra and only valid for one day. As always loved the tiki room especially the pineapple ice cream and now they have a raspberry flavor by itself or in a swirl.space mountain was renovated to accommodate star wars so instead of it being pitch black you are able to see the rails of the ride but still pretty cool looking.

Alot had changed from when I went as a child but alot was the same which I was happy about because it brought memories.

Disneyland Park consists of nine themed “lands” and a number of concealed backstage areas. Throughout the park are “Hidden Mickeys”, representations of Mickey Mouse heads inserted subtly into the design of attractions and environmental decor.

Search the calendars to make sure you try and get a good day.  There are so many events that happen all the time.  And I definitely recommend getting the MaxPass with your ticket.  It saves you from running around for fast passes and you have photo pass on it so you can harangue all the employees with cameras for a picture that you can download from the maxpass at the end of the day.  Worth it!And look, I know you probably spent an arm and a leg on the trip, but if you take little ones with you, give them a nap.  Losing out a couple of hours won't be such a bad thing when your kid is refreshed and happy until the end of the night instead cranky and crazy.  I know this doesn't always apply to every kid, but I've seen so many kids that clearly need a nap and parents are just powering through, telling the kid to stop whining.

6697,"I'm sad to say that this will be the last year we buy annual tickets to Disneyland. Although we have enjoyed our time at the park in the past, both Disneyland and California Adventure, we no longer enjoy the experience. The park has become to overcrowded, even in the off season, and this past year has been filled with problems parking, rude park employees, extremely long lines, and the atmosphere created by rude and impatient park visitors has climbed so high that it is no longer an enjoyable experience. We live in Southern California, but we usually buy the Deluxe Pass. I understand that Disneyland is working on phasing out the 2 Southern California Annual Passes, and I would have to agree that it may be a way to keep attendance at a more reasonable level, but most people that are Disneyland Fans, opted for the more expensive regular annual passes. If I could suggest 1 way to improve the experience it would be to add a 1 day fast pass for all park visitors that purchase an annual pass for the year. I myself wouldn't even mind paying an extra price for that 1 day. As it stands, you can get a fast pass for each park for one ride. When that pass expires (1 hr time), you can get another pass. However, it's sometimes difficult to do because the fast passes have either stopped giving out passes for the day, or the time on the pass is hours away and sometimes you are not going to be at the park during that time.So, I have to say that unless they offer a 1 day fast pass, we will not be visiting the park again after this season.Update 2017:Since they have reinstated the Southern CA passport, we decided to give Disney another chance. We haven't had too many problems this year, although the parking garage still seems to be an issue to park in when you go early in the morning. The other lots are easily accessible though, and have buses to drop you at the park.They are changing the way you get fast passes, so it seems that the wait between getting the pass and actually riding the ride isn't as long as now, but the fast past lines seem to be longer on a few rides....We'll see how that plays out, but hoping for a shorter wait.... And we'll see how it plays out once you can get a fast pass on the app too...They changed Soaring over CA to Soaring over the World....not a fan of the new scenes..If I would complain about 1 thing, it would be that, please change it back.Overall, the experience was better, but employees could work on social skills...they are very lacking",3/5,5 years ago on  Google

6699,"After years of visiting Disneyland and loving every memory’ and every Disney movie and spending 1000”s  on Disney cruises and parks in California and Florida.  I was recently visiting Disneyland ca with 3 grand kids and family. I arrived a day late and so had purchased what I thought was a 3 day pass instead of a 3 day hopper that I had purchased for Daughter, son and 3 grand kids.   On my grand daughters birthday and as we were re-entering the California park I was told I had to walk to a ticket booth, not a close distance, to buy a hopper pass at 8:01 which ofCourse meant I would t make it  as the park closes at 9. So on her birthday, I left alone while the rest ofMy party went into the park.  Upgrading to a hopper an hour before close meant I wouldnt have time, obviously.   Do you people realize how ridiculous it is to pay more to go from one park to another especially at the prices your charge ?  Seriously. I paid for 3 days and would only use 2 but couldn’t  re-enter a park for 30 minutes. Who dreams up these stupid rules. Needless to say, I left   alone and my family went on without me with my grand daughter crying. She is 6.Im not a rule breaker  by any means, but really?   I did not have enough time for me to get all the way to a ticket booth to pay to re-nter by 9.  When I talked with a manager she said I had a deeply discounted ticket. Really? $215 for 2 days?  For $50 I  could upgrade and enter at 8:40 pm. It closed at 9.I’ve always believed in the magic of Disney, but no more.  It’s honestly about money which I have. But will no longer give to Disney.

It is definitely more of a theme park versus just a bunch of rides like I am used to from Six Flags Colorado. I also love that they have done some good planning when they designed these rides because a lot of the areas where you will be in line are indoors.  I also love the whole fast pass thing it makes it a lot easier to get to the rides you want to go on and not have to wait in huge lines. And there are a lot of things to do at the park that are not rides and you can enjoy yourself with entertainment and food. And of course all of the cast members are super sweet.

I am sure they can find a better way to make it easier upon people who don't want to see the parade to get through the park especially with how costly things are.

Only a couple of complaints we have are1. Rides such as Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain Railroad seem slower than normal.2. Food is subpar at best.3. They started handing out Apples and Goldfish crackers in Trick or Treat lines? Who decided that???? Kids go Trick or Treating to get candy, not Apples and Crackers.

6778,"As a kid and as an adult there is just something about Disneyland that can put a smile on your face no matter the occasion or time of year. Someone who had never been recently asked me what the fascination was and I couldn't quite put my finger on it. The rides are great, but other nearby parks have better ones. The price to enter is higher than other parks and with food and souvenirs it feels like you have to dig into your 401k. And as an adult I don't get the same fizz from seeing my favorite characters wandering around, knowing there is someone inside sweating uncomfortably. The lines are almost always prohibitively crowded unless you FastPass (or Max Pass) with a plan and with a purpose. But even with these pieces that seem like detractors I still give it 5 stars and my wife and I come to Disneyland from Phoenix every year rather than other nearby parks. There is something magical about the history of Disney that you feel a part of when you come to the park, it is always clean, the rides are iconic and classic, and the attention to detail in the design is second to no one. The one piece of feedback I would give is that the employees are less engaged now than they were 5 years ago. It used to be that everyone expressed themselves in a way that made me envy them for their job because they seemed so happy. This time it felt like employees were working and no longer fit the title of 'cast member.'  In their defense this is purely attributable to the park goers. I've never heard such bad language from fellow patrons. There are now more tattoos and 'wife beaters.' More people throwing trash on the ground and being generally rude to the order of things.

During the weekdays there is a lull in the afternoons where it's a little less busy but picks up after 6PM with the influx of evening AP members arriving for fireworks.Off season attendance has lighter crowds. Plan your attractions: fastpass -- standby -- fastpass as much as possible. The mobile app, ""Maxpass"" works well and is worth the $10 per person.Fireworks, Fantasmic and Parades will draw crowds away from the more popular attractions, so if you don't mind missing the shows -- go for the rides [hint] the fireworks seen from Thundermountain are awesome!Food is reasonably priced for a theme park resort. But if you want to save money, you can exit out to Harbor Blvd for a variety of cheap eats.Be patient with the crowds, courtesy goes a long way to making your stay a pleasurable experience.

It brings me back decades every time I walk under that train trestle.  That's part of what keeps bringing me back.In the eighties, a day at the park equated to another chance to meet up with a total fox, or at least look longingly at hundreds of them.It was also a time for my boys to roam around as a group, without parental supervision.I remember making out with one of my female friends on the Haunted Mansion, and then acting like it never happened.Then there was the other time that Ronnie and I wiggled out of our Doom Buggies and started smacking the back of all passing buggies.  The operator ended up stopping the ride until we were seated.  I fully expected to be escorted off the premises, but for some reason, we were spared.I remember dancing in the character parade, with a costumed partner.Once, after waiting a long time in line at Space Mountain, I found a little kid's Superman wallet with $40 inside.

Even the cast members were indifferent to anything, refusing to help without being pressured, and not once did anyone say ""Have a magical day"" or even acknowledge our friend who had a First Visit pin on for 2 of the days we were there.We have been to Disneyland and Disney World multiple times, our children are 19-24 now but Disney has essentially been part of our family since they were born, and on our way home, everyone in our family agreed that we will probably never go back Disneyland again. And California Adventure was no better. I could go on but there is no point, there was little redeeming qualities in the Parks this week at all.This is the total opposite of Disney World, when we were there last year it was amazing... nice people, busy but well managed, extremely friendly and outgoing cast members who seem to actually care if you are having a good visit, good food (much better than Disneyland) at every Disney park we went to.I could go on and on about this, but I just hope someone who is planning on traveling to Disneyland reads this and it helps them decide on Disney World (or something else instead), because unfortunately Disneyland has lost it's magic and it's just a people churning revenue machine and it's extremely obvious.

I will never recommend any one to buy fastness that was total waste , put 10 dollar per person per day. But you can't select all the rides there, one you select one ride , until you cover that, you can't plan other one. so, max you can get three rides which you get free in app only if you plan early. food options are very less and costly also.  some shows runs on particular time only, show timing are not there in app. 4 rating is more I can give based on my experience.",4/5,4 years ago on  Google

6918,"We went on peak season during Thanksgiving break. My daughter who just turned 6 enjoyed it so much that she kept telling me how thankful she was for taking her there.

The shops were also fun for her, she picked out a music box. We wanted to do so much more but our dear daughter is knocked out by 7pm, and couldnt wake her for Winter Wonderland show.Cons:It is very crowded, felt like sardines squeezed in can. We did MaxPass which helped a bit with the line wait-time but it is only available at certain times and ride. The food places are limited, not much variety from different region. I suggest to add more world cuisines since I know a good amount of tourists from other countries visit here, possibly somewhere in Small World area. The restrooms are like another ride, the line is always long so give your child plenty of chances to go every other time you see one. Tip to those who has stroller, attach balloon or light up toys to the handles to easily spot it especially at night when returning from rides or shows. 97% percent of strollers are black, some times employees move them around to clear entrance-exit ways or adjust its position to line them up.Overall, it was a memorable time.

I ordered the grilled citrus chicken with freshly grilled vegetables and it was delicious. An unfortunate negative was the ending for the day, when the much anticipated Mickey's Mix Magic was performed at an extremely high volume, so high that I and others were forced to listen to the very loud show with our fingers plugging our ears to lessen the decibel overload.

6934,"Disneyland the happiest place on earth, well we are not happy, nor were we treated like so called guest, more like criminals. On Wednesday January 14 we took our 2 year old granddaughter to the Disney Parks, since we have mobility issues we have electric scooters ,If you need a wheelchair or scooter you know what an effort it takes to hold a child on your lap. They want to honk the horn or pull on the lever to go. If you rent a vehicle at the park you may not have a child ride with you. So my husband designed a small chair that sat behind his seat on the scooter.  We went through security and were allowed into the park and went to  Calif, Adventure where we spent about 4 hours with many comments from cast members and guests alike about what a good idea the child seat was. Then we went over to the Disney side of the resort. There some security people surrounded our vehicles while we were at the Tiki room but nothing was said later we were approached by two people who told us we had to leave because we could not tow with our scooters. We did not think we were towing since the seat was attached to the scooter and did not have wheels of its own and was attached to the device made for such things on the scooter. Eventually they escorted us out of the park like common criminals, This is how they treat the disabled and people with ideas, Since we babysit our granddaughter full time and have no way to take her to Disneyland now we had to give up our annual passes. We are very upset with Disneyland and feel that we were grossly mistreated. We have been true Disney fans sine the park opened and have spent much time and money enjoying our favorite place only to have this most unpleasant experience.

I had my little JJRC H47 elfie drone and they would not let me take it into the park despite my saying and promising not to fly it and don't plan on taking on taking a selfie stick either, apparently it can be used as a weapon. I had to take the shuttle all the way back to the parking lot and back while my wife and daughter had to wait for me in the then hot california sun. I'm half Asian so the following is not a biased or racially motivated statement. The park had a very large group of Chinese nationals and they were oblivious to common social etiquette. Constantly attempting to cut in lines, leaving trash behind them, violating personal space boundaries and stepping on my feet. Many of then we're just plain obnoxious. We were there for 12 hours, ending the night with the castle fireworks show and the Fantasia based show with additional fireworks and all character involvement for the finale.

Disney Corporation has taken full advantage of it by steadily raising prices until it's pretty much unaffordable for a lot of people. My +1 and I had annual passes, but after finding out how many days are newly ""blacked out,"" and how much they've raised the prices for literally EVERYTHING, we can't continue to support the place. Parking seems to go up a few times a year, now, and forget about trying to order any food at a reasonable price. $8 for a stale slice of pizza?! And as another person stated, they've started class warfare with new ""Preferred parking"" at $35. You've got to be kidding me.Anyway, my +1 still loves the place because it reminds her of her childhood, and drags me there more often than I'd like. Personally, I think that the atmosphere gets really old and the renovations don't justify the constant price hikes. It's geared for little kids and teenagers, so there's really no appeal for grown adults. However, it's still filled (and usually overcrowded) with young adults, many of which are covered with pricey memorabilia and sometimes even ""cuts"" (leather vests with patches) of some Disney enthusiast group or another trying to look like a biker gang, but with Mickey ears.

How could they when they're not the ones paying to spend a day there.  It's horrible.  I stopped going to Disneyland a year ago for this.  And the years leading up to now were less and less.

This caused a problem in crowd control because these natives go to Disneyland as if their life depended on it every week.  Parking is about an hour.  Never mind the L.A. traffic going to Disneyland.  Wait times for rides or restaurants are about an hour. And the ride lasts a couple minutes.  The crowds have sucked the magic out of the park.  I've been going since the 70's regularly and it was always fine well into the 80's and 90's.  Going on a Sunday was amazing.  No people!  Today it's wall to wall people.  What happened?  Somewhere in the 2000's something shifted.  Maybe it was after they expanded the park into this ridiculous resort.  Now you have to park 7 miles away, then wait with the crowds to board a tram since there is no easy way to get to the park.  By then you're annoyed.  And Disney started that affordable payment plan for annual passports and the park crowd level spun out of control and permanently stayed that way.  Disneyland will have to make some drastic changes that fix the crowd situation or they're going to be losing interest from regular folks more and more everyday.",2/5,7 years ago on  Google
6959,"I went to Disneyland 3 years ago and I LOVED IT!!!! There’s a reason they call it ‘The Happiest Place on Earth!!!’ I found myself just smiling more than usual, there’s something in it for Everyone. I found California Adventure Park to be very relaxing just strolling along. The Mickey Mouse ferris wheel was AWESOME, Loved The Toy Story Parade, You could easily do that Park in a Day, Disneyland itself however you need more than One Day- I mean its fun but you CANNOT do it in a Day. Loved Space Mountain, The Indiana Jones Roller Coaster, Peter Pan’s Flight the list goes on. I’ve also been to DisneyWorld in Orlando and Euro Disneyland but Disneyland is something you’ve got to do at least ONCE in your life. Check it out 😊👍🏽🐭🎉🏰🎡🎢",5/5,2 years ago on  Google
6960,"I didn't have high hopes for Disneyland as my only previous theme park experience was at SeaWorld, which was terrible. My girlfriend loves it here though, so we went for her birthday and boy was I surprised. The park was very clean and a lot bigger than I expected. We arrived at 'rope drop' to beat the line for Smugglers Run at Galaxy's Edge and it was totally worth the wait. I'm not a fan of what Disney has done to Star Wars but this section of the park was jaw-dropping. The attention to detail in everything couldn't have been better and somehow they even managed to make waiting in line it's own experience through the variety of animatronics and things to awe at.The rest of the parks produced a similar experience, my favorites being Cars Land and Frontier Land. Very cool overall and I'll definitely visit again which is saying something for someone like who dislikes crowds of people and mostly people in general 👍",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

Waited 20 minutes to be frisked before entering Downtown Disney  and 10 minutes in line at Lego Store.  2 days before Xmas and only 1 cashier.  Please help me to understand. Would not validate my parking because my purchase was only $12. Summing up it cost me $25 for two $5.99 bags after $12 for parking. No ESPN. No Rainforest Cafe.  No House of Blues. Plenty of outside bars. Now I understand more clearly the wait to get in. How very disgusting how so many people but into this mentality. The price parents will pay to give their children things they think they need instead of what they really need. Will not be back🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓.

I even picked the most magical time of year to for my first visit (Christmas!) From the fireworks, to the parades, light shows and rides...this place was pretty great.My only complaints are the subpar food (at Flo’s V8 and Red Rose Tavern, specifically) and the cast members (employees).The food at DCA for Festival of Holidays was pretty unique and delicious. Everything else was kind of hit or miss (especially Disneyland’s beloved churros...sorry, but they didn’t blow me away).As for the cast members, you can tell there are a  select few who truly enjoy their job (like the Disneyland Band). On the other hand, there are many others who are rude or have no personality. Most of the people working in Frontierland are retirees who are hard of hearing and cannot move through customers quick enough. Other CMs, like the ones who assist with parade routes, are pretty uncaring and have a bit of an attitude as they push everyone off sidewalks and out of streets. If you’re in the way of a rope, they rudely tell you to move or give you a shove. As someone who has never experienced Disneyland prior to this, I had no idea what to expect..but that type of behavior was certainly uncalled for.Regardless, I tried my best to overlook some of those select CMs who clearly do not live by the “Happiest Place on Earth” motto. Walt would roll in his grave if he knew how some of the CMs act toward guests. Hopefully Disneyland notices this and makes necessary changes to prevent this. If you don’t like your job dealing with tourists, you don’t have to work at Disneyland. Plain and simple.",4/5,2 years ago on  Google
6974,"The attractions/rides were not all operating as intended. Long waiting led to circumstances unforeseen to me, and rides like Indiana Jones ride had become closed after waiting in line for 20 minutes, the haunted Mansion was not operating but it was not disclosed. The Matterhorn ride and the Space Mountain ride were  a little uncomfortable with seemingly abrupt turns that kind of hurt my back throughout the ride. On the It's A Small World ride it seemed as though it was under construction with many sections dark or not playing the music. The Fantasmic Show was very difficult to view with the viewing space unorganized and a bit chaotic. It was a difficult to find places that serve Tea.

I can cross this park off my list forever. Will never ever return. Oh, and the castle is closed for refurbishment, so they stuck it in a box with a lame painting in the front, high winds killed the evening fireworks and instead we got some blurry projections on the castle box. Lame. Overall it feels like a cheap version of Disneyworld. On the positive, i loved California Adventure Park, but the fast pass situation got out of control, they were down since 2 pm, so wait times got ridiculous and a lot of angry people. You can order food on your cell and pick it up, i felt this was an improvement from DW. If you have a disability pass, then gou have to stand in line at guest service (few locations around the park), to sign up for each ride before you want to go on it.

Great rides like Space Mountain and Haunted Mansion.Cons: busy and a bit pricey. Best to go early in the morning (opens at 8 am) midweek, download Disney app and buy tickets and get a maxpass for everyone in the app or better on a PC (create a Disney  i.d.) before going to the park. Once in the park, use the location part of the app (next to home icon) to get a fast pass for your favorite ride while you line up for Haunted Mansion, etc. Bring photo i.d.  with you to the park for everyone and try not to bring a purse or bag, you'll get in much faster. You probably won't want a jacket. Do bring a water bottle if you like and food if you have a special diet. Cali and Cdn residents look for special 3 day tickets before you go for price of 2 days or less and you can get in at 7 am one day. Careful, some tickets may only be valid certain dates, look carefully at ticket before you buy. Don't push the kids too much. To relax and chill out, try the Riverboat or USS Columbia.

This allows the individual to reserve a fast pass for the rides with the MaxPass App, it cut the wait time down to about 40 minutes on the average.The prices for food, beverages and goods appeared to have gone up a bit, $6 for a 12 oz. icy,  $15 for a balloon,  $21.95 for 2 Lego mini figures, $9.99 for a small metal friction car, $15.99 for a tiny lunch plate.Be prepared to spend max $$$ for minimus of goods and services.

My boyfriend and I took his two boys for their first time (and his first time since 1983!) and it was overall just the BEST weekend ever. Their FastPass (and our upgraded MaxPass) was worth every penny and eliminated all lines. Plus we got free pics with characters and on the rides. Even food lines weren't horrible and we stopped at all the best food stands around the park. It was magical from beginning to end and the fireworks show was outstanding. Can't wait to go back - it'll become an annual visit for us! (Great excuse to go and visit my OC family and friends as well).11/15/13 - 3 starsI grew up in Anaheim Hills and had season passes to Disney through most of my childhood. I guess that's how you've got to do it because one-day passes are not easy on the wallet. And you have to buy delicious food (like the giant turkey leg or a churro), which can also run a little pricy. They also have sit-down restaurants (we dined at the Blue Bayou) and even shops with healthy snacks. That part is pretty wonderful!As an adult visiting here, I found the long lines and crowded food courts to be slightly overwhelming. I've celebrated here on a New Year's Eve, we came for my sister's 21st birthday and my husband's 30th. I'd be happy to return for a celebratory event, but won't be picking this as a destination for any of my birthdays. I'd rather go camping or to the racetrack.Perhaps if we one day have children it'll be more exciting to bring them to the most expensive place on earth.

Disneyworld is by far the larger and better park, but Disneyworld is the original so it's kind of a must-see. Got to see and do everything in one day though in the main Disneyland park so there's really no reason for me to come back other than to maybe do the California Adventure Park.

7111,"This place inspires you to enjoy and celebrate youth, whether it's remembering your own youth when visiting Disneyland as a child or seeing the excitement on a child (yours, nephews, nieces, friends, or even a child you don't know when they see their favorite character, place or ride).  It's the guarantee that despite the long lines and crowd, a positive and innocent moment will be created that will be forever ingrained in your memory. That moment will be so strong that even though over the years the price of admission and food will rise, Disneyland will continue to lure you back to recreate and relive those nostalgic memories because deep down it makes you happy.

Your entry ticket becomes your fast pass, never loose this ticket.It's Disneyland!  It's exactly what you expect and delivers if you are a child or Disney super fan.

7130,"Oh, how I love this place!  But it does get pricey...so here's my tip for making the most of your visit: use RideMax!  Go to their website, put in when you'll get there, what rides you want, when you want to leave...and it will calculate an itinerary to give you the shortest total wait time in lines.  Where you are will be where the crowds aren't, and you won't waste so much time trying to reach a consensus on where to go next (""Wasn't Indiana Jones great?!? Okay, next stop: Haunted Mansion—let's go!"" vs. ""Okay, what does everybody want to do next?"" <<insert pandemonium here>>)  Costs $15 for 90 days usage, and worth every penny.  They have excellent tips on the site as well (best place to park, when to arrive, what days are best, etc.).   Don't wait til the last moment to try it out, though...it usually takes me several itinerary versions before I get it just right.And remember, if you get pooped out...the Grand Californian Hotel (the entrance passageways are next to Sephora in Downtown Disney, or near the Redwood Creek Challenge Trail in California Adventure) has a gloriously beautiful, quiet lobby...with plenty of overstuffed chairs just right for power naps, even a fireplace to rest by...and if the kids are still wired, they can watch the continuous Disney cartoons playing in a corner of the lobby while the adults recuperate.  The nearby Storyteller's Cafe is a great place for a meal, too...so go there first, get your reservation, and take their little twinkly coaster with you while you rest....it'll alert you when they're ready for you!",5/5,7 years ago on  Google

In the evening around 6 pm we decided to walk back to the hotel. Just passed through the station I walked up to an elder lady who was in the duty at the station to ask her what is the qualification to get on the tram? After she saw my tickets, she said come in if you like. What a shock why the same tickets that I can't take the tram in the morning but now I can.

There are tons of people here.  They come from all walks of life all around the world.   They come en masse.  If crowds are not your thing, then avoid these parks.Yes!  It is a small fortune to get into the parks.   There are ways of doing it on a budget and there are ways to cut costs.  With that said it is anywhere between ~$110-$147  per person per day depending on what type of ticket you get.So.  Now that we have the negatives out of the way, let's look at the positive side.1. Rides.  You come to these parks for the rides and they are pretty good.    There are fast rides, dark rides, kids rides, and of course the train around the park.  All the rides have a really good track record for safety and with the fast pass/max pass system, it makes getting on and enjoying these rides that much easier.2. Shows. Yup there are shows and always random entertainment. You can visit with characters, see shows at the country bear jamboree, see movies in the Hollywood land area, and watch old Micky mouse cartoons on Main Street.There are amazing shows like world of color, fantasmic, and the fireworks display.  It is amazing to see these events and watch the entire mass of people come to a halt to view the spectacular show.The parks are always very clean considering the amount of people flow through these parks.  There are always people walking around scouring the parks for litter and waste.  Seconds after you see some litter, it's almost guaranteed to be gone.The staff are friendly and helpful.   Like dealing with any people in the world, the nicer you are to them, the nicer they will be to you.   They are some of the nicest people around.  Yes, it is their job to be nice, but they seem genuinely happy to do their jobs.   Safety and security are Paramount at the Disneyland parks.  I am a every day concealed carrier of a pistol and the Disney parks are one of the few places I feel ok about not being able to carry.All in all.   You get what you pay for as long as these things are enjoyable for you.  There is a certain ambiance that goes with these parks that you just can't put a price on.

Rides are very exciting and although some will make you shout out, you will not fear for your life. It really pays off to get an annual card too. Yes, this means that one day is not enough to see everything. Bring comfortable shoes, an extra layer of clothes and get there early. You want to stay there all day and all night to see the fireworks display. No fireworks will ever be the same once you see the Disney show. Best spot to watch them is at the top of Main Street. People will take their spots even an hour prior to the show. The park gets more magical at night so it is a great place for a date. ;) There are disney photographers who can take more professional pictures of you up until the closing hour. You can download a Disneyland app to book your fast passes for rides, see the standby waiting times live, view the map and made food bookings to skip lines. Parking is $20 and from there you will take a tram to the Disneyland park and/or California Adventure Park. The service will never be disappointing. Everyone is great and if you are unlucky to get stuck on a ride, someone will come to rescue you and comfort you with an extra fast pass.

In the middle of the ride ""Soaring "" everything just jolted to a stop, leaving us stranded on the ride some 50ft in the air for about 30 minutes.  Three attempts at rebooting the power failed, and it became somewhat unerving when a three person medical team arrived to observe.   Not to worry though, when we finally came down the Disney folks gave us an extra ""fast pass"".  Ooooh!We also waited in line for 40 minutes for the Haunted House when the line stopped moving.  We were greeted by a staff member who anounced the ride was broken and they had no idea when it would be repaired.  The people in line next to us said they were turned away similarly on two separate occasions this morning at the cars ride due to malfunctions.The fast pass program also seems to be failing even when you get on the rides because the average waits were 30 or more minutes.  They were issuing way too many fast passes for each time slot, probably the product of just too many people in the park.The attention to detail and the quality of the experience has taken a back seat to cramming as many people in the park as possible, in an effort to maximize the bottom line.

The lines are much too long, the tickets are WAY expensive, and the food is overpriced. At the end of the night after the electrical parade, they had shut down all the rides, my family was walking around Tomorrowland at the time, they wouldn't let us leave the area. My mom was sick of it she took all of the family and we walked right past the cast members. When we were walking away we heard that the firework show was cancelled. Our whole family was devastated. Especially my three year old brother, he immediately started crying when he heard us say we were leaving. As we walking away all of the rides started opening. My family ran to get on. We barely got to get on 3 rides at the end of the night, and we only got on about 8 at the beginning of the day. We had 12 hours to get on about 30 rides and only got on 11. Disneyland has lost its magic. My family spent over $900 dollars here, that's $900 dollars down the drain. I'm positive this is the last time I ever go to Disneyland.",1/5,5 years ago on  Google

We missed half the first day for a vape pen. Stupid. And the most fun the kids had was jumping in the raining wet puddles. Terrible time. But park was cool.

7254,"Disneyland is an awesome place, however, I always have a bad experience with the staff. When I was little, a Mickey Mouse pushed me away (literally pushed me away) when I came up to him since it was my turn in line. A family butted us in line and the person in the Mickey Mouse costume clearly saw that yet he decided to push a 7-year-old girl away and took pictures with that family first. I was traumatized and never trusted the staff in those costumes ever again.I went to Disneyland last summer with my cousins, but I was the only one who could speak English. They were visiting from Korea so I was under a lot of pressure to make sure they had a great time! I was struggling with one of the Cars ride fast pass stations and asked one of the staff there for help. Big mistake because the guy just ripped the tickets from my hand and mocked me saying ""NEXT TIME READ THE SIGN."" That was very unprofessional of him and I could clearly detect some racism as well. I was really hurt by the way he treated me.I had a lot more bad experiences with the staff but I will just stick to talking about these experiences to make this review shorter.

But be highly prepared for one of the busiest parks I've seen - often couldn't move around freely and was always bumping into someone.Queues were just unbelievably long for every single ride - no exaggeration, most were well over 70 mins. When you're queuing in the boiling hot weather every time you go for a ride it can take the whole experience away from you.

7268,"My name is Danielle Reyes, I am a 25 year old single mother of 2 who recently spent 5 days between Disneyland and California Adventures with my two children and 17 year old niece. I have never been more disappointed in my life after spending about $8,000 in food, hotel stay, and park tickets. My 8 year old son and 5 year old daughter did not even want to stay 3 out of the 5 days because crowds were so bad and they could not walk ANYWHERE without someone stepping on them or running into them LITERALLY. WE COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING OR WHERE WE WERE WALKING. We have been through so much trauma from abuse and death in the past few years we are finally alone and in a good place. I was so happy to take them to the parks which I haven't been to in over 15 years.... it was a NITEMARE! ALL I wanted was for my kids to experience the happiest place of earth and finally have some fun and peace in our life's. We went as soon as parks opened each day. I cannot get over the fact that when we left I asked if they had fun and they said not really. The long wait times and rides out of service were nothing compared to just walking, Walking from one place to another, and the treatment of your staff was the worst. I was told that we were holding up the line and my party of, one 17 year old and an 8 year old could not wait in line when my 5 year needed to step out and have me take her to the restroom after standing in line for 30 mins in a 60 min wait time ride... that's ridiculous... It was 9pm and finally there wasn't as much traffic so we stayed tired but wanting to ride rides, your staff member yelled at my 5 year old on the pirates ride because she wasn't moving fast enough to get on. I AMOST LOST IT ON HER... her words to my daughter exactly were.. LETS GO, LETS GO, KEEP IT MOVING, WE DONT WANT TO HOLD UP THE LINE. My response to your staff member was... do not yell at my daughter, how about your tell them nicely to get on the ride and greet them as if we were in the ""happy place on earth"".. she stared at me, rolled her eyes and walked away. 50% of the rides we went on or questions we had for any member in the park they ordered us around as if they were annoyed we were there and were not nice to the kids. IT WAS RARE that one of your staff was ""friendly"" and made us feel welcome and we greatly appreciated when we came across said employee, but it is sad that it was noticeably different. It really bothers me that this company will allow the maximum captivity to be what it is. We all want to make money, but for people like me and my family who look forward to and have to save for years for this kind of trip was really disappointing. In light of this email I hope that this company will take into consideration the experience your guests are having when it comes to crowds and maybe do some better crowd control to ensure that your guests are not piling on top of each other barley able to breathe.

Can coke is 2.25 in the vending machine. Wouldnt of minded paying that for a bottle coke but not for a canned coke. Should be better signs on the vending machines. Was told there was breakfast. Found out in the morning it would be about 35 a person.

7282,"Well in my first one day tour, I found this place bit over hyped. No doubt there are a bunch of good rides and plenty, literally endless list for covering but,in my personal opinion, improper use of maxpass / fastpass makes the famous attractions an agony.  It's like even if you buy maxpass, you can use it for very limited places, the restrictions are set such a way that, it's not helping people with or without maxpass anyway. Still I would suggest to use maxpass, as it doesn't cost much compared to the tickets, and helpful for 2 or 3 rides even more sometimes.One special mention, the fireworks show at 9.30 is spectacular, a must see, that was such a treat for eyes!",4/5,4 years ago on  Google
7283,Great way to have some fun but you have to be smart. Buy a Max pass and don't wait in lines over 60 minutes.  Use the Disneyland app on your phone to create fast passes.  We got their early stayed until 4PM then left for 3 hours. While we were out of the park you can still create fast passes on your phone. We came back at night and went on every good ride in under 20 minute wait time since we each had 4+ fast passes each.  Another tip is to go in the single rider line with your group.

Then fast passes did not work most of the time because too many ppl used it .. Lol worst thing is we lived at the homewood suites by hilton which is an half an hour walk from the park. We wanted to drive it to save time to enjoy in the park but turned out to be a diaster .. disney city hall Izzy said oh I understand what you experienced but you took a spot in our parking lot and there is nothing I could do. YES we spent $20 for you to waste 2 hours of my life!! How does that count? They offered fast passes and max passes for future use lol which is $10 per person .. really? Anyway didnt even bother to go on the second day although we brought a two day pass. So yea.. they gave us the second day to be used in two years but I dont think I would ever come back unless management changes in this resort which honestly sucks compared to disneyworld.

The reason whyI am giving it a three is because half the time the park smelled like urine, literal urine. To top it off I don't know what is going on with their staff. On countless times so many of the cast members were speaking innapropaitly about their life (which is to be expected) but they didn't even acknowledge people who were trying to ride the rides or buy From their shops. Another thing is when we were passing by a parade another family was standing just watching for maybe 10 seconds and a cast member ran up to them and put a light up baton in their face waving it right next to their eyes not an inch away from their face telling them to keep moving. People do not pay the kind of money Disney charges to be treated that way. Another instance was a time when my son was across the line and was getting to his dad, a staff member opened up the gate for him ( nice yes but wait) and when my son was scared because he is still young my husband just got out of line so they could fix what was going on the cast shared snickered at my husband ""sure go ahead ignore me I'm not here anyway"" I was so taken aback by the cast members behavior in all aspects of the park.

Galaxy's Edge is open and no longer over-crowded and is a great place to get green milk and $200 light sabers. I strongly suggest staying at a Disney hotel for the early mornings, and get a MaxPass so you can not only skip lines, you can make your reservations on your phone instead of using kiosks. Hit the most popular rides first before lines get too long, and they get shorter as the day gets hotter, getting longer again as the day starts cooling off again later in the afternoon.

7359,"I had no expectations of trip to Disneyland being anything too special, but boy was I pleasantly surprised. I rarely use the word ""magical"" but here it would be appropriate.We visited both parks and I can't find anything to complain from the whole long day. Everything just worked 100% and all the details were ironed out and implemented in wonderful and perfect way. Everything looked gorgeous and the sound of the park was awesome. We even visited it during Sunday and there was some kind of special event and there were lots of people, but still we did not feel crowded at any time. The food was cheaper than we expected and it was really good. We even got gluten-free choice in every place, just needed to ask.We did not queue more than 10 minutes to any attraction thanks to the FastPass system that we could even just use from the mobile app and did not need to walk to the attractions to get the FastPasses. The attractions had such wonders that I have not seen in any other park that I have visited, you should really visit at least Star Tours, Toy Story Midway Mania and Soarin' Around the world. We did not get to visit everything, but we also loved California Screamin', nothing too special but just good old rollercoaster experience.And the parade, you should really go see it. We did not even know that they had that everyday just happened to be there when it started. The music, the talent and the characters, everything was just so perfect and all the people watching the parade were so happy that it brought a tear to my eye remembering all these characters from my childhood that I had not paid attention to too much recently.My girlfriend also really liked the different characters that were wondering around the parks. We had to queue for some of them for 15-30 minutes, but it was worth it for her. I really liked the patrolling Stormtroopers that were really in character, and the Goofy and Pluto and everyone there, thanks for the wonderful performances to everyone.The price is of course high, 170 dollars for the two parks per person for one day, but here you get your moneys worth with the park being open 16 hours and everything being so perfectly designed.

The lines to go on the rides are obnoxious and we really didn't see the disney characters out walking around like we expected. There were long lines just to meet the characters. The disney fastpass option isn't what one might think either. It's an additional $10 and you basically make reservations to get on certain rides. They do not allow you to have more then one Fastpass reservation at one time. So if its 10 am and you have a fastpass reserved for 730pm, you do not get to use your fastpass elsewhere until you have used your first fastpass. Premium character dining should be reserved months in advance as you will not be able to get the premium character dining even a week in advance. The one positive to the fastpass was that we did get to download copies of pictures taken on rides without having to pay 14.95 to do so.

7373,"I went for Pixar Fest yesterday (Thursday), and was super underwhelmed. There wasn't a lot of Pixar themed anything except a few snacks and a quartet singing ""Toy Story"" songs. The 9pm parade was canceled due to ""unforeseen"" events. People we're camped out for over an hour to see this parade before they were told the parade wasn't happening. The MaxPass  wasn't as helpful as I had anticipated. You have to wait 30 mins to 90 mins before adding another fast pass. It's so hard to plan on getting these fast passes without draining your phone first. The food is mediocre at best. I had the corn dog, chili cheese dog, caramel apple, and ice cream. It consists of brands you can get at the super market, nothing special to Disney.  The 9 dollar at Toon Town popcorn was awful and extremely salty. Some ""Cast Members"" were rude, and most looked like they didn't care about the so called ""magical"" experience.  There was a raw sewage smell in some parts of the park. For the price of the ticket and MaxPass upgrade, it's not worth it. The MaxPass needs improvements to make it more efficient for people to use. Better instructions on how to use it as well. Oh yeah, I absolutely HATE it when ""Cast Members"" push you out of the park before 10pm. They treat you like cattle, and it's annoying. Parking to get in is fine, but to get out is hard. No one is there to guide traffic. It's $20 to park, which was to be expected. You don't get a discount for buying things ahead online. Last time I was there for the traditional light parade at night, we got kicked out mid parade for a Disney After Dark event. Don't overlap events, and take away from the people that should get to see the parade in its entirety. Like I said before, it's difficult to do what you want in one day with or without Fast passes.

7384,"A lot of people are complaining about crowds and ticket price. If anything, Disney should charge MORE per ticket in order to keep the crowds at bay. No one is forcing you to buy tickets. My advice: stay for several days (multi-day passes are deeply discounted, and you won't feel as rushed); never go on holidays or weekends; use fast passes; don't waste time running between the two parks, see all there is to see in one area before moving to the next (you'll waste a lot less time running around), get there early and get in line for the busiest rides first, or get in line during the parades (if you stay for multiple days, you've probably already seen them); and finally, stay at a hotel near the park, you'll avoid daily parking fees along with those long shuttle lines. If your children are small or easily frightened, consider Legoland; it's less crowded and the rides aren't as scary. Have fun!!",4/5,6 years ago on  Google

The announcements are only in English and Spanish. That part of the magic is very noticeable. I also noticed that it has turned into a little Mexico. You don't really see all the different nationalities there once was. I don't enjoy California Adventure. It's just an ordinary amusement park.  I guess it's just like the last Disney movies. The Magic is gone. That's really sad. The full length cartoons were so much better looking when the were painted cells.

I would have just bought my tickets at Embassy Suites hotel but they didn't offer the military discount. We originally drove up to the parking lot and they were going to charge us $20 just for parking to buy tickets for the next day. The parking attendant gave me directions where to park for free so I can just purchase tickets. I parked at the Cymba lot in downtown Disney. I asked over 5 different people that worked for Disneyland including security, parking lot attendant, and off duty park ride operators and they all gave me the run around where to go purchase tickets. I even had one security guard tell me I could even goto the Disney Resort and purchase tickets, but after the fact you have to be a hotel guest in order to buy tickets from the hotel and I was staying at Embassy Suites and not at Disney Resorts. Me and my wife ended up walking around in circles and never bought our tickets that night. If you have employees that work for you then please keep them informed about simple things of where to go buy theme park tickets. The only reason I even went through all this hassle because I wanted to use my military discount and we ended up just buying the tickets from the hotel we stayed at and lost a lot of money from not being able to use my military discount. Also do expect the prices to be high for everything in the park from food to souvenirs. And the lines for everything from rides to attractions are ridiculously long and expect to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour.

This is the little kids side of the Disney park, so many rides and attractions for toddlers and preschoolers.

The other issue I have is the food cost is criminal worst of all its cafateria food, if we pay so much for a meal it should at least be high quality, and they charge like 300% mark up on most items and force you to park a mile away so your less likely to leave to eat, however I highly recommend bringing snacks and drinks and leaving for meals Denny's IHOP and a few other restaurants are close by.

I did, thats the only time I entered the room for 7 seconds. When we got back around 12am from the park. The very first thing I looked at was the TV table. Where I put the tool. I told my friend that it disappeared and she said it can'tbe cause we checked in with our keys and room was audited at the checkin time and she told me to call front desk. I called the same time and they said, they would deal with this in the morning cause of shift's rotation.We called in the morning, shared the contacts and details. And we left the hotel.There was so much inconvenience that I can't put in one review regarding calling the wrong numbers everytime they investigated the issue and more. But in the end and after 27 days they bought me another tool and sent it to me.All the fun I had in the park was turned into disappointment due to the concept of ""we'll buy you another one""Its a piece of metal and less than 50$ but one time at Marriott's. We couldn't find an item (less than 3$ value) because we were in a hurry. When we called to report a forgotten item, they went far and beyond to a point that I didn't want them to look for it anymore cause I would hate to see them investigate with their employees for 3$. But they didn't stop untill they found it and delivered it to us.Disneyland, I know it's silly talking about something not even worth 50$. And I know 4 customers won't effect your income. Not even 400 will do. But all the correspondence and talking back and forth and claiming ""we still dont know what happened"". Made me realize that there is a serious SOP issue going on in that hotel.All I know is, that is what the protocols and SOP's are for. Auditor gets in the room, do their job and leave.What happened was, I get in my room with my key I drop an item and if for some galactic reason the auditors or somebody else come back for maintenance or anything, and take the item.

There were employees trying to direct park goers to where they are supposed too be standing to watch the fireworks. One person with a flashlight would flash them in the face and direct them in a direction, just to run into another staff member with a flashlight directing them another way. By the third time being directed another direction my daughter and her friend threw there hands in the air and demanded to be directed to where they need to go! To stop covering them the run around. The employee said, come with me I'll help you out. Placed them in a spot under a tree where they couldn't see the fireworks... seems Disney needs a little more organization...

7485,"You can't go wrong with a day at Disneyland.  Billed as ""The Happiest Place on Earth,"" if you are a kid at heart then there is something for you.I highly recommend that you arrive early so that you can park in the Mickey and Friends lot.  If you are driving down the 5 freeway use the carpool exit for Disneyland Drive and follow the signs for Theme Park Parking. If you are arriving later in the day, even when other cars are parked elsewhere you will end up in the Mickey and Friends lot.  Parking (as of this review) is $18 a car.For non-annual pass holders, I highly recommend a multi-day park hopper pass. You really can't do everything in one park, let alone both parks in one day.Please leave your selfie sticks at home.  They will be confiscated when your backs are checked.Be prepared to stand in lines.  Lines to get your bag checked, lines to buy tickets (if you didn't buy them ahead of time), lines to get in, lines for to get food, lines to go on rides. There are apps that will tell you what the wait times are for nearly everything.  Use them wisely. You will spend much of the day standing in line.  Wear good comfortable shoes. Also, get fast passes for rides like Space Mountain and Indiana Jones. You can have more than one fast pass at a time but only after certain times so make sure to check your fast pass tickets and see when you can get a 2nd one. While in line, be on the lookout for Hidden Mickey's in the decor.My favorite rides are Space Mountain (Hyperspace and Ghost Galaxy are versions of this same ride), Star Tours, the Matterhorn bobsleds, Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder Mountain, the Tea Cups, and the Carousel. Everyone has their own favorites so find yours!You can't go wrong with the food in the park, but if you want to eat in one of the restaurants make sure you call a few weeks in advance and get a reservation.  It can be near impossible to get reservations the same day.If you aren't too exhausted by the end of the day, make sure to stick around and watch the fireworks extravaganza.  You'll want to pick a spot an hour or more ahead of time and I would recommend someplace near Main Street with a good view of Sleeping Beauty's Castle.",5/5,6 years ago on  Google
7486,"Cons first:I'm SO disappointed with Disneyland, it's not at all what I remember going as a kid.  I was really looking forward to seeing my kids faces light up when they saw their favorite characters but there were NO characters walking around AT ALL like they used to!!!! We used the app to try to find them but they weren't out they were only in the parade.  We will not come again on a holiday weekend because we could care less about a parade. We wanted pics with our kids and the characters. It was so crowded too!  The staff at the Roger Rabbit ride in Toon Town had to call security cuz some idiots were smoking weed in line and a bunch of ppl left to take their kids to a different ride.  The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was closed so that was a bummer, I would've liked to have known that when I bought the tickets.  The fireworks show is complete unorganized chaos. I wish there was a better plan for seating.  Restrooms are not well marked.Pros:I absolutely loved the app! I recommend to anyone with really small kids especially infants & do the fast passes!!! It's only $10 per person and you choose the ride and 1 hr window u want for the specific ride! As a breast feeding mom I was super pleased to see they now have a Huggies care center for nursing infants, warming bottles etc although I chose not to use it.  My husband really liked the new space mountain ride being set up as Star Wars! With all the cons being said, my kids had a blast for their first time there even though they didn't see but only a glimpse of Buzz Lightyear & Woody from a distance!

At the end of the day, we were beat but also bummed we couldn’t hop to Disneyland for an extra two hours because of the day pass.The next morning was a magic morning at Disneyland and first thing we got was fast pass for Fantasmic, then we headed to Tomorrowland, etc- at the end of the night- we rode over 24 rides and thought the next time we come back, we will probably skip CA. Disneyland has better crowd control and there’s so much to do. I liked the app option with max pass instead of running to get them at the kiosk. The line will be longer, but it’s worth it. I was kind of bitter to see so many people on their phones while in the park, in line, even on the ride- like “does no one appreciate Disneyland anymore?” Get off your phone and enjoy the beauty of the park and attractions!!Our last night, we wanted to see Fantasmic and I couldn’t believe that even though you got a pass, it didn’t guarantee you the front row seat and when the cast member allowed us in, it felt like Black Friday where people where pushing and shoving to get to the front, I couldn’t believe it.

Even the special characters were in a hurry to leave, which most of them would only stay for about 10 minutes and then leave and they would not return.  Disneyland has over sold the amount of tickets that its park can handle.  I am surprised by this as it is a fire hazard and I am surprised that the Anaheim Fire Department doesn't shut it down..  The entire park is standing room only!  If there were to be a real emergency there, it would be a while before any emergency vehicle can get there so if you have any conditions DO NOT GO THERE!.  My suggestion to Park Management is limit the amount of tickets that can be sold and announce those facts.  Separate Park ride goers from attraction goers.  Some people just want to get in there and attend the rides and leave.  Create a Fast pass system like Universal Studios so that people who want to pay a little more for not waiting so long can do that.

7526,"My daughter and I came here the week of September 20-23, 2018, and I have to say this was our worst trip to any Disney Park EVER. The crowds during this entire week were insane. Shoulder to shoulder people in both parks.  To allow so many people into the parks that it’s shoulder to shoulder people, just lets me know the sheer greed for the almighty buck this place has. I’d happily pay double just to not have a cluster screw of people pushing and shoving and standing on my feet!!  Souvenirs are astronomical along with the overpriced lackluster food options.The lack of anything different and exciting to eat, plus the fact they’ve had so many major places to dine pull up shop and leave Downtown Disney made dining in any place mundane to say the least. If you did get lucky enough to nail down a dining reservation, the food was overly priced and lackluster.On another note, is the lack of any type of transportation up to the parks. You WILL walk and a lot! No bus, trams, etc like at Disney World. This is kind of problematic for people with painful mobility. If you’re not an active person by nature, you need to train before going there. You will be sore as you’ve ever been after walking upwards of 10 miles a day/night inside an overcrowded theme park.Lastly, our hotel room was a little dated. For a Disney property I had anticipated and hoped for better. Wallpaper peeling on the walls, stains in the bathroom, mildew in the tile grout. My daughter got chocolate on the white bed linens she slept on. The maid didn’t bother changing the sheets the next day, she merely made the bed up. The walls were paper thin in the room. The people next to us had a child who was obviously in the terrible two stage, as the child screamed and cried for hours on end and every bit was audible through the adjoining wall! No luck taking a nap or getting to sleep at night without hearing screaming and crying.I’ve noticed as well that for the most part, employees do NOT smile here, unless they’re in full princess garb or in costume and HAVE to. I jokingly mentioned a desire to be put to work to one employee, and the look on his face and his response to me, it all let me know that while guests think that Disneyland is the happiest place on earth, the poor employees don’t.My last rant is going to coincide with crowds. They’ve gotta do something about the sheer amount of damn strollers that are being brought in!! There’s not any out of the way places to stash these cumbersome baby movers, so they’re parked on the sides of public walk space. On our visit we saw strollers parked 3-4 rows deep, taking up much needed walking space. So you fight strollers on top of shoulder to shoulder people in the parks. It’s just gotten to the point of being ridiculous. No one attraction in either park is worth waiting 30+ minutes to ride for mere minutes, fighting outrageous crowds getting stepped on, shoved, and dealing with line cutters. EVERY attraction we stood in line for there was ALWAYS THAT jerk letting family members or buddies cut in line with them, irregardless of how many people were standing in the lines waiting.",2/5,4 years ago on  Google
7527,Tired of the same old stuff with higher prices tagged on. This probably will be one of the last times that I ever visit Disneyland and I'm actually happy to say that. $300 for 2ppl to enter is insane and I won't pay their prices again.,1/5,3 years ago on  Google
7528,"It is magic! It is awesome. I loved it so so much! All the rides are fun! Two parks, three day ticket, first day - Disney Park, second day - Adventure park. Increadicoster is just awesome, Guardians of the Galaxy too thrilling! Day three repeat the Disney park - it is just magic, Tiki Room with their pineapple floats as a treat! Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted house, Splash Mountain - just pure enjoyment! I really recommend to visit this Anaheim park. Just one hour from LA. A lot of motels nearby if you choose not to stay at Disney Resort",5/5,3 years ago on  Google
7529,"Gotta be honest, we were very disappointed with our recent Disneyland, Disney California visit. We are used to Disney World and were reminded why we prefer FL to CA immediately. These two parks are ran completely differently, and CA Disneyland likes to remind ppl of that, which is not a compliment.  I needed to get a disability pass due to recent major surgery, and after waiting in line over an hour, they told me there is no pass for me and I should get a wheelchair. We would have had to pay several hundred more for a scooter and gone in another line. After another 30 min of my hubby having to argue with them, we got a nice manager lady who gave us the pass, that we were told doesn’t exist. Keep in mind I already know about pass based on website, my surgeon, and my emails asking about it with Disney. Just because you can’t see my scars, or all the cysts and other things cut out of my abdomen, doesn’t mean it’s not an issue. I could have shown proof, but they didn’t want it. In the end it was super helpful to have pass if you have major issues.Food- Prices go up and up, but quality goes down. We like the Chicken sandwich with slaw @RedRoseTavern. That’s the only meal we enjoyed inside Disneyland, California.  Fries were good everywhere, but nothing else unfortunately. Even the Starbucks tasted watered down. The clam chowder in La Brea was superb to Disney watered down (potato) clam chowder.Ugh, food allergies and sensitivities. Again we are used to DW where they have lots of food options and more knowledge/caution of allergies. I asked the hot dog Award Weiners(very nice ppl) about MSG in their hot dogs, I had to say Monosodium glutamate, and the nice lady said “yeah our hot dogs do have sodium🤦🏻‍♀️”. She ended up getting me the Nathan’s hot dog box to look at, which was very helpful.No one we talked to, knew about food allergies. No special kiosks or carts.Friendliness- Disneyland cast is simply not nearly as friendly, not even remotely close to FL.We met 3 friendly cast members for our stay. The curly blonde, tall, skinny, gentlemen at Alice in Wonderland last Wednesday morning, I think his name was like Ezekial or Ezeriah 🤷🏻‍♀️, was the best and should be training everyone! He was in character, made eye contact, friendly, smiling and truly seems to enjoy his job! Give him a raise and have him train!!A couple of the ladies in fantasyland smiled which was a shock...shouldn’t be a shock Disney!  Most cast members don’t look at guests, just wave you on in a huge hurry, and talk amongst themselves, very sad:(Cleanliness- most bathrooms were ok, but tables at quick service locations- none were wiped down. Sticky tables & chairs, food left on tables. Messy floors too. Cleaning Guys at Tomorrowland  wore theirs pants too low and we don’t want to see their underwear.  We cannot believe Disney allows this!Rides- we haven’t been to Disneyland in 8 years. Many of the same rides breakdown like Roger Rabbit, little apologies and cast very frustrated. Many of ride times were underestimated. Husband was in a 60 min wait time for Guardians of the Galaxy and it turned out to be a 95 min wait!Many other rides were 10 min+ over, estimated time.Grizzly run was spinning the entire time, it was not like that before and not enjoyable.Matterhorn was so rough both our necks hurt before we got off ride.Cars land was very nice, and the highlight since DW doesn’t have this,but lines were so long.We will be sticking with Disney World. Disney is raising and raising pricing, quality is going down and very noticeable. We in exchange have been visiting much less and spending less, hope others do the same and maybe we will get better service again.",3/5,3 years ago on  Google

If the line for the metal detectors gets too jammed up they will let a large crowd through without going through any metal detector at all.

7533,"EDIT: Park employees will be getting $15 an hour soon, which is a big improvement. Added a star.Disneyland & California adventure are great vacation spots, no arguments there. The reason I rate the parks 3 out of 5 stars really has more to do with the treatment, or rather the lack of livable wages, the park staff receive.Disney is a multi BILLION dollar company, a company practically monopolizing the movie blockbuster market, not to mention the dozens of companies bought by Disney which make them revenue.I believe the management of the parks needs to take a good hard look at their priorities. Until the Disney corporation starts putting their people over profits, “the happiest place on earth” is just an illusion.I understand if you just want to take your family their for a good time though.

Sharing this experience with them, sheds a new outlook and wonderful light on the amazing cast members of Disney!!

ALL of the characters in costume, Mickey, Minnie, and others were WONDERFUL without words portraying the joy and excitement. Multiple characters took the time to spend extra time hugging my little one who didn't want to let go. The park was incredibly clean and well kept.

The Indiana Jones ride was also broken, but was not properly shown on the app as a down ride. The reason I did not bump them down to one star is because their Pixar fest parade was legit. In other words my child really enjoyed it and it put a smile on his face. The firework display was also spectacular like always.

I know live very close to DL so I made the visit. First, I do enjoy the parks. I was also impressed that it feels like Disney. I forgot I was in Anaheim which is something I’d heard mixed reviews about. Disneyland does a great job with hiding that you’re minutes away from the sidewalk. Disney World doesn’t have this problem as the property is expansive.Disneyland’s castle is very, very small and underwhelming. It isn’t impressive AT ALL. The parks are extremely busy at time so if you’re a local, go during the week and the off-season.Don’t miss the flag retreat every evening. They start about an hour before sundown and have people from the military come and stand during their military song. It’s pretty cool to see.Try the Dole whip by the Tiki Room. Don’t get the float. It’s not worth it. California Adventure has alcohol so check out that park for a different feel. That’s also where the iconic Ferris wheel is.Frozen live is great.

My daughter and I go for 3 days usually Tuesday thru Thursday and never waited more than 40 mins for a ride. Every time we go we ride all the big attractions and some multiple times. And yes I have ran into 1 grumpy cast member all the times we have gone. And it does not ruin our day at all. Its called worrying about yourself and your attitude! As far as food, yes it is a little higher than your average restaurant Like a $1 or $2 than places outside of the park (referring only to quick service). I share meals with my kid to save and you are allowed to bring food out of the park and leave and go across to street to iHop/Dennys/McDonalds. Which is a good plan anyways to relax for an hour or 2. You all wouldn't be so grumpy if you took a mid day nap after lunch. because being on your feet for 10-14 hours is a lot.

Maxpass combines Fastpass which allows you to queue for a shorter line and Photopass which allows you to have photographers take pictures of you and your party at awesome locations and characters: both are an absolute must-haves if your taking a family!First, Disneyland: 2.5 StarsThe Disneyland park was clean and the service was excellent. The fireworks show was amazing and they even produce snow for the Frozen segment! The Fastpass selection was pretty lame compared to Disney California Adventures. There were signifcantly fewer characters in Disneyland too. On a 3day park-hopper Maxpass, we spent 2 of them in Disneyland (wish we'd spent 2 Ca. Adventures). There were loads of great Photopass locations in Disney and the new Star Wars land lives up to the hype. WARNING!!! You have to make reservations at Savi's Workshop starting at 7am the day of, to build a custom $215 lightsaber. Not interested in building one? There are legacy lightsabers in the store available too. Yes, it is worth every penny if you're a fan. My 10 year-old son and I both built one and it was an experience we'll cherish all our lives, no joke. If you are looking for someplace to get a margarita to help with the Sounthern California heat... you're screwed. Olga's Cantina is by reservation only (good luck, this is tougher than getting a lightsaber) and Club 32 is private membership only that cost more than the ticket to the parks. So if its a cold adult beverage you are looking for you're gonna need to use the park-hopper feature and head for Ca. Adventures.Disney California Adventures:5-StarsThis place was amazing!!! There were characters everywhere you looked!!! There are fewer Photopass locations but there are loads more Photopass opportunities with characters. The Fastpass selection of rides (and rides in general) are far superior. Oh, you can also get 21 and over beverages here which makes it all the more enjoyable to deal with the heat. Maybe its because there seemed to be fewer international tourist on my visits to this park, but the crowds are far more respectable towards people with strollers and personal space in general.PRO TIP: If you are using Maxpass, you have to download the Disneyland app, and then scan your entry tickets under 'My Tickets and Passes' which can only be found in the 3-bar menu button on the bottom right of the homescreen. This is what allows you to use you mobile device as entry tickets, fastpass tickets, and Photopass links to get all your great shots straight to your phone!",3/5,3 years ago on  Google

What happened to DISNEYLAND????  The prices are extremely higher than the quality of the experience and service that is being provided.  First of all, we got there at the opening of the park and you would think that the first thing my daughter would have seen was Mickey Mouse but needless to say we didn't even see him the whole day??  How is that possible when Disney was created around the character & for what you have to pay their should've been at least 5 Mickey Mouses walking around the park at certain areas, in particular the front entrance!   My daughter dressed up in her princess outfit anticipating to see one and did not see one princess walk around the whole day but was told later you have to go to a designated fan area to see them?  We were at this same park 6 years prior for my sons 7th birthday and the experience was well worth the price!  My older kids, 17 &14 were off to the rides but I noticed that they spent the majority of their time waiting in these ridiculously LONG LINES and it didn't matter fast pass or not,  you were going to be waiting for a while!  Then the food quality was sub par at best but definitely not worth what we paid and in fact I would almost consider it to be a criminal exchange.  Lines for everything,  to include taking a picture when you first come in of the Disney lawn?  Please!!!  a line to take a picture of the grass with a Mickey silhouette carved in it is a waste of your man power and all patrons time!   Their are not enough places to sit as I am a disabled veteran and even thou I have limited mobility I did notice allot of elders with grandchildren who could have used a comfortable spot to take a rest.  The one highlight of our visit that we enjoyed was the excitement our little one had taking a picture with  Minnie & Pluto but unfortunately it was when we were leaving right at the exit gate.

I'll give you a few examples, notice how incredibly happy all the employees are, they'll never point (if they need to indicate direction they'll use at least a couple fingers or a whole hand), and how clean the park is (this may seem like an easy feat, but can you imagine keeping a park with this many thousands of children and families wandering through *this* clean)?They do an amazing job of segregating all the different worlds/areas within it to make it feel like multiple parks within one giant park. They're also constantly doing renovations to update the rides and maintain their safety (how often do you hear about safety incidents on any Disney, or California Adventure for that matter, rides)?

7642,"We recently visited Disneyland on Saturday, October 7, 2017, and had arather unfortunate experience. My husband and I were ableto enjoy most of the park on a busy day, which was great as it was his first time, but it'll probably be our last time.A huge damper was put on our visit when we went to ride Splash Mountain. I was so excited to ride as we used one of our fastpasses and bypassed a 90 min lineup. I was worried when we were put in a boat with four other men (my husband and I are by no means tiny) but I figured we would be fine if a cast member thought it was okay for that much weight  in the boat. The ride was great, we had a monumental tidal wave that thoroughly soaked us - all in good fun!What was NOT fun at all was when we got to the unloading zone the boat was too heavy to make it back up the mechanism - we were stuck just beyond the emergency exit. After about 15 mins the cast members unloaded all of the other boats but told us to stay where we were. Due to liability, the jump to make it back to the emergency exit was too big. We needed to stay where we were in order to not be escorted out of the park. The fire dept had been called and would be coming soon.More than 60 minutes later the firemen showed up, only to tell us ""Sorry it took so long but someone called us and told us you didn't need us anymore"". That was NOT something that you want to hear after waiting for so long to be 'rescued'.In the 60 minutes that we waited our boat was a spectacle for all the people in line. We were pointed and laughed at, photos and videos were taken. Some of the men in the boat were visibly very uncomfortable with the additional attention and requested numerous times that the lineup to be cleared from sight to stop the ridicule. Nothing was done - Cast members themselves all came to check out the situation - not to be confused with 'Check on'.At no point was there communication to us or regular updates - there was no 'are you okay' from cast members, or can we get you anything. One request made by another one of the men was just a simple plastic bag as his phone and camera had been soaked and ruined from the splash - he had to ask four times.The issue isn't that we were stuck or that we had to wait. I get it, rides break, stuff happens and it's all a part of the experience. The thing that's so upsetting is that this is DISNEY. The epitome of customer service and the place where the magic happens, NOT a place to be pointed and laughed at, underserviced, or shrugged off.I followed up with Disney customer service and received a cookie cutter canned response ""we're sorry the ride broke"" and ""we're sorry you had bad service"" cut and paste out of an employee manual.I completely understand that things happen, rides and attractions have technical difficulties. Our experience was a little beyond 'disappointment over the temporary closure of Splash Mountain', it was the fact that we WERE the temporary closure of Splash Mountain as a result of poor judgment of the staff. As such we were treated distastefully by all staff, not to mention the harassment and spectacle we endured during the wait.We had already missed the fireworks.Visiting from Canada for the weekend we only had one day in the park. I asked if we could talk to someone about the possibility of a meal voucher or gift card for the shops we were shrugged off and they told us to go to 'city hall' customer service, where I could wait again and loose the rest of our ONLY evening. We had at this point already lost almost 2 hours of our very limited time in the park.It would be nice to receive a genuine apology for myself and the other men in the boat. This is Disney... the epitome of customer service and the go-to example used in all experiential marketing. I'm hoping they can make it right and restore the magic in my eyes.I would also strongly encourage a weight distribution disclaimer for your staff at Splash Mountain - rather than cramming the boats full, consideration of safety first.Disneyland is NOT what it used to be.",1/5,5 years ago on  Google

Turns out, they have even less than most retail stores. We were also told that the parks are separated into two, so we had to choose between Marvel and Star Wars. We chose Marvel as staff told us that the Star Wars stuff isn't as big right now due to construction, but it was a small area and the ride was constantly a 2 hour wait.

Yes you can get a FastPass and if you pay extra, because $100 a day isn't enough, you can get better FastPass.Food is expensive but that's not exclusive to Disneyland.The Disneyland app is actually pretty useful.  You can make dining reservations which I found really useful because trying to find a place to eat last minute can lead to, what a shock, a long wait if you want to sit down to eat.The experience is clean and safe though.

7664,"First of all, even though it wasn't the greatest experience my daughters wish was fulfilled when she met Minnie Mouse and all her favorite characters. That was worth all the bad experiences. Let me begin, the ticket purchase was a smooth and great experience, the lady was full of grace and smiles, loved it. Once we entered and made our way to Toontown that is where my daughter met all her favorite characters and had a great time with waiting time not being more than 20mins. The crowd was crazy!! I have never experienced such a crowd before, people constantly bumping into each other, rude, pushing you out of the way and cutting in line. It wasn't the most ideal situation. Once we made our way headed towards the castle my daughter was interested in a snack, we stopped at the stand right outside the castle and the rude young lady asked me what is that you want so I can ring you up!! In my head my impression was, 'Wow, isn't this suppose to be a happy place??"" I walked away and she rolled her eyes at me when we denied to make the purchase, while also saying to her I am sorry my presence has become an inconvenience to you, she replied yeah it has thanks for leaving, right there I just wanted to leave the park. Everything inside the park is pretty pricey, However, they have the most adorable things we just had to get my daughter. When trying to board pirates of the Caribbean, they took everyone out of line , no explanations and shut down the ride, we later found out(when in line again) someone tripped and fell while getting off the ride. Indiana Jones wait line is always a long wait we didn't even bother. Lunch time came around and we were in tomorrow land, eating at Tomorrow land Terrace, customer service was poor, all burgers were great, no one got sick, my younger brother had the chicken sandwich with avocado salsa and about an hour later he was sick, constantly going to the restroom and we made our way to the medics there and they were of help by offering some over the counter drugs. The light Parade was great and my Daughter and Son absolutely went crazy seeing all their favorite characters. Overall, it was okay. I suggest to purchase FASTPASS, Don't shop at the stands, instead opt out for a sit down meal. Bring your own snacks. Its permitted. Keep in mind all major attractions have an incredibly long wait time. Also, make sure you call out the rude people to park attendants when in line otherwise the wait time is just longer and longer because no one says anything.

In one day I was on three rides that broke down and after waiting for 20 minutes I was not able to get on the rides.Disney shows a great lack of care and consideration for their customers. They could have easily waited until they finished their renovations and repairs to do a price increase. Instead they asked their loyal customers to pay more for a substandard experience.Sad that I will no longer have faith that a day in Disney will lead to a guaranteed amazing experience.,1/5,3 years ago on  Google

First off, the cost to enter the park is outright outrageous, but going to Disney you accept you will be gouged to the limit for entrance.  But what really got me was the lack of staff visible at times for assistance.  The wait times for the rides routinely exceed 60 minutes, where most of the time is spent in lines.  The food was just lousy in the park if your a vegan.  The only place to eat was the fruit stand near the starbucks on Main St, and some French imitation place where we found a salad.  For the entire two days, we only saw one character walking the park.  When in Disney world, the characters were always walking the park which always animates the kids.  Don't get me wrong, the place is Disney and which kid does not like it.  The only good thing from this trip is my kids have begged me not to come back to Disneyland :-)  Better value to go Six Flags or other attractions.

7684,"This is to an extent the Disney I remember when I went 32 years ago. However a lot has changed.  The Hopper ticket if you have a bunch of little ones like I did.  Don't Bother getting it, you will waste your money.  However I do recommend getting a Two Day Pass.  It's the only way to get through the whole park.  Also if you have a choice, AVOID the Summer at all costs. You will Suffer the wrath of the Crowds and the Humid Heat. Now here is where I frown on Disney,  as much as the tickets costs and as much as you pay to get there, as I mentioned I had a lot of little ones and the main thing they wanted to see were the Characters.  The Positive is that with the free Disney App, you can see where they are at.  However the wait time was out of control.  The other was that if you did find one walking through the park,  We literally had to RUN after them to get a picture or for them to acknowledge any children, NOT COOL DISNEY. I literally had to run and am in good shape to get a pic.   It's not like the ads you see on tv.  I hope Disney World is not the same.  Now the cool thing that Disney is doing is the Fast Pass which is free.  I honestly would not pay for the Max Pass, you really do not need it. Basically for the popular rides you go over to the dispenser put in your ticket and retrieve a reminder. Then you go elsewhere, get on other rides and when it's close to the time you get in the fast pass lane and boom you are on the ride within a 5-25 minutes, Not bad Disney. Another cool thing is the ability to take in backpacks.  I took one with an insulated 9 can bag which saved me a bundle of money. I was able to put snacks for the kids, water and gatorade which helped keep them hydrated and fed.  Which is awesome.

Magic morning was a bit of a joke as only 2 parts of the park were open and they let about 10000 people in so wait times were rediculous. They also had the matterhorn, pirates if the carribian and a few other rides closed which was a bummer. What we were able to ride were well done and true to the theme. Haunted mansion was exactly as I remembered it (amazing) and my husband and son loved California screaming and space mountain.We used the disneyland app for wait times and as our map which was handy but not always accurate.

A lot of big rides are closed or breaking down during the day. I'm used to long waiting lines but not in front of toilets. Because a lot of them are also refurbished. You have to be a total Fanboy of Disney to visit this park a second time. Indiana Jones Ride was great and worth the 1 hour waiting in line. I don't get the fast pass system. In order to make it work they have to make the people stand in line in front of the actual attraction and therefore the nicely designed interior waiting spaces that would be interesting to watch during your waiting time.Don't write this is the best theme park in the world when you have seen nothing of the world. It's clearly not and the prices for everything can only be explained by the brand Disney. Apparently, if you slap the words Disney on someting it's value goes up for 300%.

Even though I am an adult woman, I was fairly excited to experience ""the happiest place on earth"". I was sorely disappointed when I left.The fiasco of parking began our adventure - I am not sure what they are doing with their parking lots, but we were forced to park in the Garden Walk parking garage, for which they had put up temporary signs to direct us, but they conflicted with the permanent signs for the parking lots creating an overall ridiculously confusing experience. In addition, the parking attendant issuing the permit for parking in the garage was not only unprofessional, but clearly high on something - my husband, who was the one talking to him, suspects marijuana.Then when we arrived at the park, we were confused as to where to go after the bag check, and the staff did not seem all that interested in directing us. This seemed to be an ongoing theme inside the park as well. More than once I was confused about whether the attraction was a ride or a meet-and-greet with a character and/or which line was in or out. Also, the ""fast pass"" was never explained to us, nor were we given a map - we eventually found one outside a ride in Tomorrowland.It seemed to me that the only things to do in this park are to walk around, buy things, and eat. Not much amusement for an amusement park in my opinion.There were two shining rays of light on our day in Disneyland, to which can be accredited the two meager stars that I am even giving this place. The first is Blue Bayou restaurant, which we were given outstanding service by Mary, our server, and had wonderful food! The second, was the Disney Gallery where my husband and I bought two sketches which are lovely and we will proudly display in our home.

Don't go! If it's clearly out of your price range and you are miserable that you paid that much.... stay home.b) crowds/lines: Really? Duh! It's Disneyland! Do your homework. Your research. Your ""once in a lifetime"" trip wasn't worth the time of finding out the dates or days that are less crowded than others?? In your hometown great restaurants are full on weekends at the best dinner times and unless you've planned ahead and made reservations you'd be locked out. Go to Disneyland when California kids will be in school/ go early to Disneyland right when they open/ hit more rides late, late at night after the crowds have thinned.Be smart. Why do you think it's all about you??c) rides being closed: Look online and see what will be closed.Unhappy with that answer? Don't go! Rides need maintenance. Usually this will be occurring before summertime/prime season.d) stop whining about your experience as one who is a vegan, immobile, or other special cause in which you feel entitled to have everyone stop the presses to take care of you and your situation. If you are a vegan. Bring your own food. Etc.e) wait time to meet special characters, including Elsa:If it's a 3 hour wait...don't do it. Why would you? Unless it's worth it to you. Then - do!

7748,"I'm absolutely  certain there's nothing I can say here that is going to change anyone's mind about going to Disney, but here goes...1. The place is dated and dull. It's the same rides you remember from 20 years ago with updated names. For the most part you'll sit in a car and watch things pass by. Hardly a ride.2. It's out of control expensive. Two days of standing in line is going to run you $195 per person, but there are plenty of ways to find discount tickets. A hot dog will set you back $9 and a Coke $3.95.3. The lines are ridiculous. Even if you master the fastpass system, you spend more time waiting in line than anything you'll do all day. One particular ride had a wait of 50 minutes, but we decided to avoid the wait after timing the ride at 65 seconds.I could go on and on about how time has passed the place by, the cost and the lack of interesting things to do, but odds are you're dealing with a kid who wants nothing more than to see the kingdom the rat build.

7749,"The place is still great... if you are not a twenty or below.  The conversion of small world and fantasmic fo fast pass rides has pushed kids out of formerly easy to get on attractions.  Small world before fast pass was about 15 to 20 minutes wait.  Now it is over an hour.  We have skipped fantasmic since the conversion.  Another issue with fast pass is having the kids passes since they bounce between mom and dad throughout the day.  It was convenient in the past when not tied to your ticket or card.  Even longer ago everyone in the party would get a child a fast pass for a ride they liked most and let him or her go over and over until fast passes used up.These parks seem to be breaking Disneys secret sauce.  We are like salmon, the places here have sights, sounds, and smell to cement the attractions in our mind.  When you are little you remember the dumbo ride and area for example.  The smells of the food, sounds of the carousel and ride, and the sights.  So when you grow out of it and then have kids you bring your kids back and the place is pretty much the same reinforcing your memories and those times when you were young.  They keep ripping out attractions in favor of new ones.  Bugs land was my kids favorite for California adventure.  They started there when they were smaller and when the oldest  was on screamer the younger could still go to bugs land.   Now it is gone and my oldest daughter at 12 years says the parks are for little kids.  My 8 year old daughter refused to come here since the bumper cars are gone. Even though there are other rides she is also saying the parks are boring.  When they get older they would have returned with their kids to relive their childhood.The parks are favoring marvel and star wars.  Which is more of my Gen X and the gen after mine.  The younger kids aren't into those franchises as much.  Star wars has also alienated much of my generation with the latest horrible movies.  And the marvel movies of late have been ok to blah for the most part compared to the original set, but still at least something you want to watch.  Marvel and Star Wars will take another 20 years for a generation to bring back their kids.  If they are successful in making memories with kids and kids are still coming to the parks in enough quantity.Incredibles should wake the stewards of Disneyland up how is was a sleeper hit.

The happiest place on earth, as long as a huge amount of crowds, kids having meltdowns and endless strollers don't get to your head.Both Disneyland Park and Disney California are great parks to spend time at.  I'd definitely recommend spending a minimum of a day at each.  I'd also suggest to get maxpass as it's worth the extra cost.  Doing so allows you to get fastpasses for rides (where you come back to a specific ride at a specific 1 hour window for a shorter line), and also allows you to get attraction photos and photopass photographers included.Bring a water bottle with you.  There are plenty of water fountains in the park where you can fill up your bottle to save the $3-$5 / bottles they charge.  I believe you're also allowed to bring in snacks yourself too, which helps to reduce the cost of food.  With that being said, there are plenty of restaurants in both parks (and downtown Disney) which server budget up to gourmet foods.  Carthay Circle at Disney California is a definitely must try.Stay for the fireworks show in the evening at Disneyland, and if you're able to, go and check out Fantasmic.

I think the only thing they can do is pre sell tickets and limit the number of people in the park. We went during the week and on a week when there was no school break and it was still crowded. Max pass helps but when you aren't able to get a Fastpass lines become longer because of Fastpass os it can be a bit of a catch 22. I still recommend the MaxPass though because you can get the passes on your phone and you get Photopass for free. This is nice especially if you have photos that are always missing one person from the family that is taking the picture. With Photopass the ride photos and photos from the park photographers are included. My biggest suggestion beyond lowering prices and crowding is to please please add more windows and  more staff to the Town Hall Customer Service location. There is nothing worse than having to wait 45 minutes to start your day because you have to go to the town hall to get your tickets to scan into the Disneyland app and there is a loooong line for help. Having said that, the staff in line and at the windows were nice. There has to be a way to speed this up or give folks a free anytime/anywhere Fastpass or something to compensate when lines are long.

At least at other resorts they give you a pass to come back to the front when things like this happens.

Disneyland wants you on your feet spending money.  The way to maneuver the long lines is utilize Fast Pass.  Fast Pass was developed for the frequent visitors and will help you ride fast and attend many rides.  As an old person; my favorite event is the Tiki Room sponsored by Dole (the pineapple company).  Despite my discomfort I am giving this place high marks because my people loved it.  I will defer to my people for this rating (they are the fans of merchandisism).  Disneyland collects 2.2 billion each year.  The capacity is 85,000 people. In order to achieve this revenue; an average of 30,000 people have to visit each day and each person must spend $200.92. (approximately).  Should Disneyland be free!",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

This caused my daughter to cry and caused us to have to spend alot more to be able to still enjoy Disneyland. It's not like we went going to not buy food and drinks and items that arnt faaaaaaaar over priced from what they should be priced. Each of these parks make over 5,000,000.00 a day in profits and they could not be understanding to parents who brought thier daughter and special needs son to thier buisness. The park was ok. Everything here is an obvious cash grab...every ride ends with a shop? Where do you think Disneys priority lies..with the customer experience or money...its obviously money.

We waited in line for longer then that and then the ride breaks down on us right before we are close to getting on so we wait an additional 30 minutes.  When all was done we spent about 2 hours for 1 ride and have only ridden 3 rides in 4 hours. that's when I wish Disney would find a way to compensate for wasted time. We got a 3 day park hopper and it still wasn't enough to get on all the rides or see much shows which I think is horrible for what you pay.

There's plenty of restaurants serving Italian, Mexican, American food, and I'd recommend you carry a water bottle as there are drinking fountains around.

It was very heart breaking for my boys to be turned down. They felt like it was wrong to go up to their favorite character Storm Trooper. In fact they scared my son because he lifted his arm up high with his blaster. My children were very excited and looked forward to getting more autographs and having friendly characters. This is not the experience we were expecting.  Such a disappointment. I call this false advertising in which I see on TV. Disney does not mention they DON'T have characters like the advertise on TV.

The staff culture/attitude has changed for the negative - attitude of staff (particularly ride operations and guest services staff - but candidly overall) is passive and borderline condescending vs consumer centric customer satisfaction obsessed team (the magic that is Disney).  They do not seem happy to be there and customers feel it.  The competency level of restaurant staff has declined notably as well.  Our welcome to a $500 character meal was of staff that normally would be working at a highway diner.  Plaza Inn - Entry staff rude ($500 bill for scrambled eggs and I get an attitude).  Nicole in Character photos there was great. Cierra (from Newport Beach) ride worker at Indiana Jones - soooooo beyond rude.  Too many toxic people.  Same deal at California Adventure by the way.This place is quickly seemingly becoming Six Flags-esq   :-(  Loyal customers notice the cheap changes and cutting corners to save pennies.  Be careful or you'll lose that loyalty.  Don't be penny wise and pound foolish.Also, was preventative maintenance budget cut?  Rides breaking down like I've never seen (except for at a Six Flags).  Staff show zero I mean zero sympathy for the hour i just wasted.  They’re clearly frustrated about it same. Stuff throughout entire park not fixed or painted like it used to be either.All restrooms gross - even where would expect above and beyond like Grand Californian Lobby, Plaza Inn, Blue BayouAlso - the staff force you take your receipt when you buy things even when you decline needing the receipt because they don’t have trash bins.

We went to Disney World several years ago and had the ""magical"" Disney experience, so I was really looking forward to this visit. Unfortunately, most of the cast members we had interactions with were rude or unhelpful. We had a terrible experience with ""Chris"" at Space Mountain. We showed up at 9:30 a.m. during our scheduled FastPass time, only to be told that the system was down and to ""come back any time"". We went on our way and enjoyed a few other rides, while also continuing to use our FastPass to schedule other rides. We came back just before noon, but my unused FastPass reservation for Space Mountain disappeared from the app by no fault of my own. I explained to Chris what had happened, and asked if we could get on since we were told to come back any time. He was rude, said there is nothing he can do, and told me to make another reservation. I explained again that I already had a reservation, but it got deleted from the app. He continued to argue with me, and even claimed that I had already ridden the ride and was just trying to cut in line. I finally gave up, and angrily stormed off. We went and had a ridiculously overpriced lunch, and then I went back to try again. Thankfully Chris was gone, so I went up to another cast member and again explained my situation. She started to give me the same ""there's nothing I can do"" speech I heard from Chris, but seeing that I wasn't going to give up, she got another person to help me. He took my phone and looked it up in their system and again told me I had used the passes. I told him we have never ridden this ride in our lives (it was actually closed for maintenance when we went to Disney World). He begrudgingly took my phone again and added passes back on our account. While we finally got to ride it, I should never have had to argue so much with a Disney employee. They are there to make sure everyone is happy and has a great time, but apparently the cast members I dealt with didn't get that memo. And this was not the only situation. The cast members are not supposed to say ""I don't know"" or ""I can't help you,"" but I heard that from several that I talked to when I had questions or needed help. Needless to say, this is our one and only trip to Disneyland as I will never go back. We also went to Universal Studios and the San Diego Zoo while we were in California and couldn't have had a better experience with their employees (at less than half the price of Disneyland, I might add).

I’ve spent a total of 45 days at Disneyland because I scrimp and save to get there as often as possible. But I’m heartbroken because I can no longer afford to go to my favorite place in the world. Nor will I be able to share the memories I hold so dear with my two year old son because it would have to be a choice between paying my rent, or going to disney. And obviously there isn’t a way I could justify that. I’m seriously absolutely heartbroken. Please please please stop raising your prices...

Even with fast passes we ended up standing in multiple lengthy lines.  Additionally, went on jungle river cruise twice, which has always been one of our favorites in Disneyworld.

I was ecstatic to take it home and try it out.I followed the instructions, installed the blade, ignited it and was rewarded with a brilliantly executed replica of the Hero Saber from the Skywalker saga. One major caveat: the $183 replica had a busted speaker. The characteristic hum of a saber replaced with a shrill squeak.  Whats more? A friend of mine had purchased the same model and his was functional and plastic wrapped whereas mine was just set in the case.I have reached out to Disney and have been assured that someone will get back to me, but it has been about three weeks now and I'm losing hope.Tl;dr: the park was awesome.

7857,"FastPass/MaxPass is a Joke!! I paid to stand in queue!Firstly, this Disneyland Park needs a revamp asap. The main Disney castle was under renovation and there were curtains all over it with a picture of the castle instead!! Many sections were either closed or not open for whatever reason we don't know.The park itself I think is highly over-rated. I have been to other Disneyland parks, and if I compare to the one in Hong Kong, then Anaheim (LA) one does not stand anywhere near. From the main entrance to the last ride, it was total chaos.We bought FastPass/MaxPass from the Disney app when we were inside the park. Its a total joke. It comes with so many restrictions like its available only for select rides, and that one cannot request another pass until an hour. In fact in many popular rides like Space Mountain, the queues for FastPass were as long as general and to control that they simply stop the lines of general entry! Even if you can generate a FastPass, the time slots are for 2-3 hours ahead, when you could easily wait and get a ride entering a general queue! On top of that, there is a frequent error in generating pass from the app and have to retry a number of times.We made use of FastPass in 4 rides only and felt cheated with the way this entire FastPass program exists.The rides were good.

7865,"Our recent stay at Disneyland Hotel and visit to Disneyland, Disney’s California Adventure and Galaxy’s Edge with MaxPass was underwhelming. The hotel room was clean, but there was a centipede that crawled across the lobby as we checked in and the pool and restaurants were “meh”, outdated and bland.Our main concern before heading to Disneyland was lines, but with MaxPass, we were able to visit both parks and try all the major rides on the first day.The rides at Disneyland and Disney’s California Adventure were outdated and at times, almost sad; definitely not the Happiest Place on Earth. The only places that felt new were the shops filled with merch and more merch.Our Galaxy’s Edge reservation was from 11AM to 3PM the second day. At the main Disneyland entrance, we asked a park official if we need to do anything special to get into Galaxy’s Edge, the park official didn’t know, but asked a supervisor and reported back that we should just head to Galaxy’s Edge.When we went to the Galaxy’s Edge entrance closest to the main attractions at 10:30AM, we were told that we should have read the reservation email, which would have told us that we need to check in first at Tomorrow Land, opposite end of Disneyland, to get our wristbands. We triple checked the Galaxy’s Edge reservation email and can confirm that there was no mention of picking up wristbands at Tomorrow Land.We walked to Tomorrow Land and stood in a 30 minute line to get our wristbands. Our wristband attendant then told us that rather than using the entrance closest to the attractions in Galaxy’s Edge, we would have to instead go through the Hungry Bear entrance, which is on the side of Galaxy’s Edge with no open attractions. It took us a full hour to do the entire loop around the park to get our wristbands and enter Galaxy’s Edge. I understand trying to get customers to experience the park outside of Galaxy’s Edge is good for business, but the wristband run Disney sends people on in 90 degree heat is just cruel and unusual. Disney requires all members of the party be present to pickup the wristbands with no handicap accommodations. We observed people in wheelchairs having to do the wristband run.All of the “rave” reviews for Galaxy’s Edge written by major publications talk about one of the best reasons to visit Galaxy’s Edge is the Build Your Own Lightsaber experience at Savi’s, which I am sure is on point and very true. What the reviews don’t tell you is the harsh reality we learned from a attendant upon entering Galaxy’s Edge. The Lightsaber experience is by reservation only, the reservation can only be made after you enter Galaxy’s Edge and Galaxy’s Edge can only handle 15 Lightsaber builders at a time. The attendant cheerfully informed us, just 30 minutes after the start of our Galaxy’s Edge reservation, that the Lightsaber experience was no longer available for our 11AM to 3PM time slot and that we had the option of coming back to the park for another visit or buying a pre-made Lightsaber at Dok-Ondar’s Den of Antiquities.Most reviewers we’ve read don’t talk up Millennium Falcon as much as the Lightsaber experience and after experiencing it personally, we get it. As motion simulator’s go, the Millennium Falcon is more child’s video game then actual ride or simulator. Pilots, gunners and engineers basically push buttons when they light up. We’ve experienced motion simulators at high end arcades with more immersion. Interestingly enough, we rode the ride twice since the line wasn’t very long and the ride broke down the second time. Based on the way the attendants handled the break down, directing us to go out a back entrance, these break downs appear to be pretty common.We also tried the Build Your Own Droid experience. The line was 90 minutes and building the Droid took about 5. We picked pieces off of an assembly line went to a station and used the screwdriver to screw in the arms. Again underwhelming and more transaction than experience.Nothing magical about the trip to an aging theme park with a few new rides that do not yet scale well.",1/5,3 years ago on  Google

You will have a 1-6 hr wait time before you can even show up for the reserved time of the ride that  you can only reserve for one at a time.

There is a deliberate effort to not provide places for visitors to the parks to not have any place other than overbooked restaurants to sit down. The bathrooms stalls mostly do not provide a shelf to put down the stuff you must carry around, like a bottle of water or diaper bag or an item you've purchased (I assume because they make money on locker rentals). The place has become too expensive for families with average incomes to afford.

By early afternoon, the park was so full you could barely move from one side of the park to the other. The lines were at least 2 hours long.  We were able to ride 8 rides. That averages out to about $20 a ride. I am sorry to say that there is not a ride in Disneyland worth $20. The park was so over crowded that I saw them open an alley way behind Main St. for the people to exit because Main St. was too crowed. Needless to say, this was a very uncomfortable situation.

Ticket prices are bit too high - around $119 for adults for one day and $113 for kids. It was just too much crowded...we had online tickets and entered at around 8:45 am(park opens at 8:00 am). On that day they make the park open till 12 mid night. Lot of long queues to get into any ride...around 45 minutes to 1hr. 15 minutes kind of wait..we thought may be it will go down by after noon or early evening...but it keep on getting crowded. Lot of wait time even in the food/restaurant at each and every place...when it's very much crowded - people are also not very nice. Unfortunately the park staff they were also not nice or helpful on that day. We saw two parades - around 4:00 pm and then 8:30 pm. Both were very good.Both my kids has a good time with the rides, castles, parades. Night firework were awesome. But too much crowd messed up a lot of stuff...we could hardly went into around 75% of the rides and were very tired. During night when the parade and fireworks were happening...it was totally uncontrolled mob. Disney staff were making their own rules and literally treating the visitors as cattle. Some time they even objected why you folks are standing here - why not go out- that was bit rude and ridiculous. Finally we decided to go out at around 10:30 PM and park was very crowded even till that time. Why Disney doesn't control the crowd - there should be some maximum # of people limit should be there so that it doesn't screw up visits of others. It seems Disney is more interested in mere profits. Moreover looking at the price tag for tickets and comparing it with DisneyWorld at Orlando FL - i can only say it's not a good experience at the first place.

7919,"After the fact, this park is essentially a ""rough draft"" for the improved, sister park, Magic Kingdom, in Orlando.  With that said, this is THE original Disney park and just knowing that adds an extra layer of groovy when visiting the park.  As with all Disney parks, it is super clean and cast members are very friendly.  The disadvantage with this park when compared to its more secluded Orlando sisters is that if elevated in any way at the park, there is no way to hide the fact that you are in the greater LA metro area (somewhat kills the illusion).  In any event, the Disney magic is alive and well at this park making it one of the happiest places on Earth!",4/5,6 years ago on  Google

7921,"I have been here many times over my 45+ years.  I don't like to say it, but it seems like the ""cast members"" are becoming more like employees (even at Disneyworld in Orlando).I say this as more and more there is less smiling and interaction from them each time my family and I are there.  In the past it seemed like 90% or more of the cast used to do this and this last visit (Disneyland and California Adventure) it was more like 35% engaged us even though I started with a smile and hello to them.Now I understand that things change over time and management does too yet to me this was one of the cornerstones of the Disney experience and why we pay so much to be at the""Happiest Place on Earth"".I hope someone in upper management takes the time to read and address my concerns as talking to others, I'm not the only one who noticed this.Hopefully on our next visit to any of their parks, it improves not only for my family, but everyone else too so I can change my rating to a better one.",3/5,4 years ago on  Google

7930,"I go to the parks every year and always love it! The only complaints I ever see are either about the crowds(But what do people expect) or something that is obviously their own fault. The cast members have always been kind and helpful. Some of these negative reviews are obviously exaggerated or twisted. Also, I have seen complaints about only being able to get one fast pass at a time. If you could get more than  one at a time, it would completely defeat the purpose and not reduce the line. I recommend getting a Park hopper! You definitely want to watch Disneyland forever Fireworks, Paint the night, and World of Color Celebrate! They will bring tears to your eyes. I highly recommend eating at the Blue Bayou, but be prepared to make a reservation and spend a lot of money. My favorite hotel is the Grand Californian. It is ridiculously expensive, but completely worth it. If you can afford it stay there. Christmas time is crowded, but it's the best time to go. Disneyland is absolutely magical. If you do not like then there is something wrong with you and frankly I do not trust you. Haha I just hate seeing bad reviews because they are ridiculous and not truthful. I've gone to the parks more than I can count and have never had an unpleasant experience. Disneyland is crowded. If you don't like crowds do not go in summer or on other holidays.

And all of them were allowed to cut through the line because 1 member of their group saved a place in line while the other 20 were off doing whatever.Wait times for even the most ridiculous rides was 85-120+ minutes throughout the entire day up until closing. I would HATE to see a disaster break out, for everyone in those parks would surely die a horrible panicked death.The Alice in Wonderland ride was broken, Incredicoaster broken, Radiator Springs broken, Space Mountain broken, Bobsleds being “maintenanced”, Zephyrs broken, many of the rides stopped multiple times while we were on them for “system failure,” and Goofy’s Flight School about broke my back with the sudden jarring of the breaks by the ride controllers.We had fast passes however we were only able to book TWO passes for one day due to all the passes being taken, or rides being broken.This place is outdated, antiquated, overpriced and miserable to visit. DisneyWorld in Florida is way more inclusive and better overall. I can book multi day, fast pass, park hopper, with snacks and meals included for our family for VERY LITTLE more than what we spent to be absolutely miserable waiting in line for HOURS to hop on a 1 minute “thrill” ride made for pre-schoolers.

7973,"Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It is the oldest Disney Park in the world.Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.[2] Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot.Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits since it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had approximately 18.6 million visits, making it the second most visited amusement park in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom, the very park it inspired.[3] According to a March 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are supported by the Disneyland Resort, including about 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent contractors or their employees).[4] Disney announced ""Project Stardust"" in 2019, which included major structural renovations to the park to account for higher attendance numbers.[5]",1/5,3 years ago on  Google

7990,DisneylandBy Simon S.Disneyland is a great place for kids and adults---From rollercoasters and rides to characters. Disneyland also has a lot of shows. In the morning go to Splash Mountain and then go to Space Mountain. Those rides are the best and have a long wait. I recommend to go on a weekday to skip the crowd. When you need a break go to Main Street U.S.A. There is a fantastic chocolate shop. The chocolate looks amazing. You can also get huge pops that are rainbow that are sold everywhere. They also have the best churros. In the morning when the gates are about to open go to Downtown Disney. It is all cool shops. There is a massive toy store that has everything. Disneyland is an all around awesome place for kids and adults.,5/5,5 years ago on  Google

They really did it up with Nightmare Before Christmas decors....very impressed-We hit up the princess stuff, Adventureland snd New Orleans Square...Fast Passed The Matterhorn to ride later-Most lines went at a comfortable clip, that 'toon car' ride threw me off 'cause it looked like a 10 minute wait but surprise!! 70 minutes.-We skipped the parades to hit the rides-We packed lunches/dinner to save $-For castle fireworks, the spots near the Royal Hall/Theatre the best/calmest... unless you're into big crowds...Not like that's a bad thing...-The Beauty and Beast show at the Royal Theatre? Entertaining without being too pretentious. My jaded teenagers liked it, so it's a win!-We mapped out what we wanted to really see, and avoided anything over 60 minutes, except that 'toon ride -The next morning we hit Big Thunder Mountain and the Indiana Jones ride-My kids are between 9 and 18 now and can take care of themselves...different when they were babies/toddlers, so new(er) parents maybe take note...or not.All in all, a good time.

This was outrageous and very poor customer service.My family and I were dropped off in the ""Woody"" Shuttle area and we were yelled at by a staff member - MEEK (Chicago, IL). She was extremely rude and had poor customer service towards us. I understand that we were confused by which Shuttle area to wait at as there are many stops to choose from, Buzz Lightyear, Woody, ect., however as we were crossing the street to go to the Woody area - she immediately yelled ""NO! GO BACK AROUND THE SIDEWALK!"". We stopped on the sidewalk and asked ""But we are looking for the shuttle to go to the park."" She continues to yell ""NO! WALK AROUND THE SIDEWALK!"". I responded, ""I just have a question about --"" and she cuts me off by again yelling, ""I DON'T CARE, IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION WALK AROUND THE SIDEWALK TO ME!"".This was extremely embarrassing for my family by being made a spectacle in front of all of the many guests and staff that were in the area. I couldn't believe my first moment at Disney was so unpleasant. I would have appreciated if she was more civil with her approach and added ""Please"" or ""For your safety, please come towards this side."" But her rude tone and aggression towards my family was uncalled for.To make matters worse, my family walked over to the Woody Shuttle area and when we got there, she REFUSED to answer our question! My family heard her say ""I don't want to answer their question. Have someone else talk to them."" That's outrageous that a Disney staff member wouldn't even be willing to help us. First, this staff member(MEEK) yells at and embarrasses my family - and then, she refuses to answer our question. This start of the day completely ruined our Disney trip and we couldn't enjoy the rest of the day. Just because of one poor experience in the beginning. My family flew out all the way from Florida for this one day and it was ruined by one poor staff member. I hope the training could get better for the the shuttle/parking staff and that Meek gets the proper repercussion.

8025,"Well first off my review has more to do with service then the experiences (ie. rides, characters and so on)  We bought a 4 day Canadian park pass through our airline and for our family of 4 our kids ages 5 and 3.  We arrived on May 21 2019 and our first visit was May 22.  Our park passes said that they would expire on May 23 2019  or 15 days after activate, which ever came first, I was confused by the wording so I contact the airline to confirm that our tickets were not going to expire on us on May 23 2019 and that if activated before the 23 ie the 22 then that came first.  Tricky wording right!!  When I contacted our airline they contacted the ticket provider from disney and confirmed that in fact if we activated on the 22 then yes we had 15 days cause the 22 came first, are you following this?  So guess  what on the our second day are tickets expired, the four of us went to ticket sales and explained my situation to a not so friendly lady, she swiped the ticket and said they are expired and I can't do anything for you except sell you tickets, she never directed me to a help desk or customer service, so while on hold now with our airline west jet I bought 4 more tickets for our remaining days costing $1100 US!!!  Once I talked to the airline they contacted again there provider of the tickets and told me to enjoy our day and west jet would fully refund what I had just bought and call me back.  3 hours later Westjet called us back and told us that we could pick up our new tickets at group sales and we would get new tickets for our remaining days. I went to group sales and told them who I was and she said nothing just walked away to her manager and then walked back and gave us our tickets, not a sorry hello good bye or nothing.  Listen, Disney tickets are ridiculously expensive and I would expect that the customer service would be much better then it was on this day. Disney you have a park that a lot of families go to, it is very stressful on parents and hard for the kids to stand around in the heat waiting ,when no one offered any kindness or help of any kind and  kids dont understand why they can't go into the park.

One Disney worker told me to just show them to one of the ride operators before getting on a ride. I showed them to a Kaitlin yesterday June 11, 2018 at the Dumbo ride to be treated disrespectfully. She was harsh and very unpleasant upon me approaching her to get on the Dumbo attraction. This Disney employee created a scene like I was trying to do something fraudulent upon showing her my fast passes. She spoke to me in a very loud and accusatory manner and she stated they should not be taking these immediately. As I started speaking to her she ignored me to take off with my fast passes to take them over to her co-workers to call it in right away as if I was a prime suspect, while my six year stood and watched the entire ordeal in horror. I was forced to wait over twenty minutes while another Disney employee called it in and never apologized for any of my inconvenience. The Disney employees gave me angry stare downs and were just cold towards me. I was extremely embarrassed because with me being a person of color and they were not, it was pretty obvious that I was being made to be untrustworthy as a Disneyland customer and person period. I had the envelope the fast passes came in with my address and name visible, which I gave to the Disney employees. The the Disney employees made me give them the letter that came in the envelope. I was asked was I the person who's name was on the envelope while an employee was on the phone. To make matters worse the Disney employees began mocking me and laughing at me although they stated they were laughing because I had given them paper tickets. None of what they did to me was professional or amusing.After this I went to get an ice cream sundae before leaving this place. When I get up to the cashier, Rachel at Gibson Girl Ice Cream she never smiled at me one time and was just mean. In fact after my order was place she pushed my receipt to me in a very nasty manner. I was never made to feel as though me or my family's patronage was wanted while attending Disneyland yesterday. Many of the employees are not approachable unless you are the kind of person they want to deal with.  I left this place feeling really upset and told the Disney employee on my way out when she asked how my experience was. As I am explaining our awful experience this employee was almost laughing about it. At Disneyland California yesterday it was the most Depressing Day On Earth for us throughout our experience there. Disneyland is not very well kept because it was not as clean as I would think it would have been. Our food was not good and cold for burgers.I really feel bad for my child because he was so excited about going. It was unfair to him. We kept trying to see the Disney Pixar parade because my six year old adores Disney movies but we kept being asked to move along because we could not stand anywhere to watch it. It was really crowded there yesterday so it made it hard to get a spot to watch the parade. Most of the characters my child wanted to see were always no longer taking anymore people.

Very limited Older disney character memorabilia. Star wars land was great but quite small. My biggest complaint would be how RUDE Disneyland ride employees are. Absolutely hateful ppl....it happened so often I don t have time to state everything that was said to us. Some things were fun for nostalgia reason but I preferred California over Disneyland. Even California is limit as fat as size and things to do for the AMOUNT they charge to get in.

8054,"We were all ONCE kids. Most are still kids at heart, but for me long gone are the days of fantasy (sans sports), make believe and magic. Make no mistake about it, I loved coming here, but for a long time I really had no need for Disneyland. Aside from some girls I was dating who were still in love with the idea of spending time here, I steered clear.As a child it was ""the happiest place on earth"", as a teen I would get drunk here and run amuck. As a young adult it served me no purpose, but as I've gotten older and my circles have kids I've come back and enjoy the happiness in their kids faces as we come here.As we all know it is expensive, prices have quadrupled, literally, literally. The park has expended to add California Adventure and even the OG rides have been updated.This is no amusement park, this is THE amusement park. Not for the thrill seekers like Magic Mountain, it's a family centric entertainment paradise. Staff memebers are treated like family for the most part and from what I hear the pay and benefits are competitive. Perhaps that's why so many local kids work here.They offer everything from carted hot dogs to the famous Club 33 which is a members only club with strict rules and adherence. You are paying a premium for everything here, but you'll also get certain standards, ambiance, quality, etc so that $12 burger isn't so bad as the toys your kids will want to buy.The lines were not that big a deal as a kid because you were there, as a youth it was acceptable, as an adult they are ridiculous. Fast pass or handicapped is the way to go.There are plenty of shopping, restaurants, rides, Kodak moments, but most importantly bathrooms and benches because a full day of walking is tiresome with kids and all those bathroom breaks. Saniwipes are a must with so many kids running around. It's basically a germ from top to bottom. Imagine how many kids your kids come in contact with on the daily and multiply that times 1000. So take how many times they got sick last year and that's the amount you are more likely to catch something. They aren't cleaning it all the time, all day long.Tip: if you want to see the fireworks, but not pay the pass, park at the top of the parking structure.Protip: Do not walk around with your hand out, random children will grab your hand thinking you are their parent.My review won't change what it is, or what it is to people, but until I have kids of my own to me it won't have that 5th star.

Download the app and get the max pass yes it costs money but you don't have to go to the ride for a fast pass your feet and nerves will thank you, also on the app you can order food and tell them what time you will pick it up this saves a lot of time. On a hot day Gatorade is your best friend just not the 5 dollars they charge bring your own. For the water rides bring some extra clothes like socks so you don't get soggy blisters.

I completely forgot about them when I was going into the park so of course they stopped me at the metal detector and told me that I can't bring them into the park and that I'll have to take them back to the car or else they confiscate them and destroy them. That is ridiculous. I get not allowing ""weapons"" into a family theme park but it's a couple of pocket knives not guns. Why can't you have lockers to allow us to store our stuff that is considered contraband so we don't have to have it destroyed. They gave me the option to take the knives back to the car or have them confiscated. The problem was that we were in from out of town and stayed at a place about a mile from the park so I really didn't want to have to walk a mile back to our room just for a couple of knives, one of which is a nice Benchmade that wasn't cheap. So my wife and I decided that she would wait outside the park while I went to get the tickets and then I'd come out with her ticket and she could go in while I walked back to our room. What ended up happening is I stood in the ticket line for 20 minutes (why it takes 10 minutes for people to purchase tickets is beyond me) and my wife put the knives in her makeup bag and went through a different checkpoint entrance and made it in with no problems. So, I got to keep my pocket knives, didn't have to walk the 2 miles just to put them in our room, and wouldn't you know it I didn't stab a chipmunk. We all win.

8092,"The power that Disney has is it always brings joy, happiness, love, and magic. For this reason, Disneyland is known to be the happiest place on earth. In which fairy tale dreams come true; therefore, many people all around the world visit this Disneyland park. The park is bustling and prominent all year round. It never gets too old, too cold, or too hot. Disneyland always has new adventures for everyone all year to have an extraordinary experience each time they visit the park.Walt Disney created Disneyland to be a tourist attraction for the whole family. Disneyland has entertainment for the whole family. The park includes many fun attraction rides, live shows and musicals, a fascinating parade, and my favorite: The Disneyland Fantasmic show. It is an incredible Mickey Mouse water performance with special effects; and is located at the Frontierland. The Fantasmic performance atmosphere is truly magical because all the characters come together in an enormous boat. Watching the colorful water show and the fireworks in the background are incredible. The smell of the firework smoke, chlorine water, and Disney music playing bring a nostalgic feeling. It’s a remarkable and unforgettable experience.The environment at Disneyland has a beautiful setting in which it brings harmony and excitement. For instance, walking through the main entrance gates and seeing all the buildings on Main St; looking around the park. People are walking around wearing their Micky ears, the horses pulling the trolleys, and the colorful flowers all around brings joy. It also has a food aroma around the park — for example, the smell of popcorn, turkey legs, and all the delicious desserts. My mouth waters thinking about all the desserts they have. One of my favorites: Churros. The cinnamon and sweet, crunchy taste in my mouth. The love feeling of all the birds chirping sound, the music playing, and the bells ringing is terrific. Disneyland has a monorail and train which passes through the park that people ride and enjoy.Another of my favorite Disneyland place is the magical and beautiful Sleeping Beauty Castle. The castle is right in the middle of the park. It’s not only amazing, but it also makes a great background in pictures. Last but not least, the traditional and unforgettable parade. With everyone’s favorite Disney characters and Princess.  They bring their humor and imaginative stories giving it an immense lifetime experience to live and remember.Nothing matters when you’re at Disneyland; it’s where the impossible is possible. A whole world for everyone to enjoy. Also, a place where adults can feel their inner child, and children can live their dreams come true. Everyone should experience the Disneyland dream.

8106,"The maxpass is pretty much Essential, if you don't have that, you're going to spend a lot of early, crucial time waiting in lines. Having a good battle plan on the offset is your best route, we didn't have one but I knew the essential rides to hit first off. Having studied their real-time interactive map on their Disneyland app I could gauge pretty well what the ride times would be like, and when. So attacking it from a spontaneous point of view is still doable, but there are some very important things that you need to know. Basically the maxpass dies with the Sun at least the Fastpass features of it, we did find the photo feature a bit cumbersome/convenient and sparse times. I think the public has better still cameras than Disney. Finding yourself in a ride photo, and waiting or shuffling around trying to get to the kiosk displaying the photo and or code can be a bit of a challenge. Sometimes the photo will have changed by the time you can get close enough to see the code. I did not get the scanner to work but I may have been using it wrong. Typing an unexpectedly long code in a post-ride line whilst wrangeling the youngster's  can be unpleasant, but not insurmountable. There are some folks simply taking pictures of the monitors with their phones, which can be viewed as a bit cheap and tacky, until you truly experience the cost of doing an all day, open to close Disneyland experience. It surprises me, at times, that people that would drop $200 in a slot machine, would not find this of equal or greater value. The only Edge in this case, would be the maxpass, which essentially lets you make an appointment for all the rides you want to hit. I was able to take my son for the first time to Disneyland and hit Star Tours twice once in the morning with Fastpass, and then we just waited in the standard line at night since you couldn't use the Fastpass anymore ( for most premium rides) after a certain point in time. My strategy was clear hit all of the 60 minute (wait time) rides early, since most of the crowds tend to be at the back during the day, families probably, and then filter down to the front of  the park at night, making Star Tours or Space Mountain thier last ride. I would watch the ride times on the Disneyland app the night before to get a little Intel and how the day will go. Have no Illusions about going anywhere in Southern California during August, it's going to be unbelievably hot. I think Disney could do a better job keeping people cool in the form of misting areas and cool-down areas. It seemed like it was a constant struggle even finding somewhere to sit down that wasn't in foot traffic. At the end of the night before the fireworks show started we are out in the front of Pirates of the Caribbean sitting down we are asked to move along basically, and understand this time we were pretty much smoked, all the area in front of us was filled with people behind rope sitting on the ground to watch the fireworks show. Well, it seemed like a good idea to hit some of the other rides while people are watching the fireworks, unfortunately while the fireworks were going on, Fantasyland was pretty much closed off because of the wire work I think they do from the Matterhorn. So hitting all the storybook rides was going to be next to Impossible, but wealso missed the opportunity to go to Toontown and explore it and depth as a closes early. There's definitely a way to do this, I think it takes practice, and more than a one day, and it can be done. But it will take the cooperation of your family, and more patience and endurance than you may have predicted using that day. But just know this, if you can survive going to Disneyland under immense heat and crowds, and not crack up at some point, you deserve to be held to a higher standard than the rest of us Mortals. Ultimately, I think fast pass is going to evolve into a ride appointment guarantee.",3/5,4 years ago on  Google

We went in December and yes it was packed, you can't expect some place that is known to be a big tourist destination for Christmas not to be busy.

Disneyland will not be as fun during peak seasons, but if you also expect to ride every ride and get everything done in one day you'll also be stressed and annoyed.

8125,"I am appalled at the TERRIBLE customer service of Disneyland. Disneyland is well known for the happiest place on earth. A company who is humble and full of integrity. Last weekend I visited Disneyland. I purchased my 2 day park hopper ticket through the app $280 the night before I went to the park. The app was not working for my friends so the next morning we went to the park ticket booth to purchase their tickets. While we were there the employee Nancy told us that if we purchased a 3 day park hopper it would be $260 instead of $280 which then would save us $20 even if we only were going to be there for 2 days. My 2 friends got their tickets and then I asked Nancy if I could return the one I got in the app for a refund and get the other instead. She said ""Yes, you may return any unscanned ticket"" I then asked her how to do that and showed her my phone. She then said ""There is nothing I can do with that, you will have to return that later"" She then continued to connivence me to get the 3 day park hopper so I did. At the time thinking I could receive a refund. I called the park that same day to find out THEIR OWN EMPLOYEE TOLD ME WRONG AND I CANNOT GET A REFUND. I couldn't believe my ears. I got got told wrong information by an employee. I called again the next day to see if there was anything they could do. I spoke with a supervisor named michey who didn't help me at all. She told me she would talk to the management team about the situation and get back to me. Well, when I received my call back the next day it was at the same moment I was going through security to get into the park. It caused me to miss the phone call and she left a message saying there was nothing she could do. I called again after I returned home just a few days later and spoke to a better supervisor named Destiny. She resubmitted my case to be investigated. I called again this morning because It has been 3 days and I have not heard back. Destiny told me to be patient because it is being looked into. Then 3 hours later I receive a phone call from Mark. He clearly did not fully understand the situation when he repeated what had happened to me. I then told him my story again and he told me that the staff all is thoroughly trained and they all know this policy. Also, that it is posted at each booth as well. He explained that because there is no documentation then there is nothing they can do. HONESTLY? OF COURSE THE EMPLOYEE WILL NOT WRITE DOWN EVERY INTERACTION THEY HAVE WITH CUSTOMERS. THEY ONLY WRITE DOWN WHEN SOMEONE COMPLAINS. SINCE I THOUGHT I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK FROM WHAT SHE SAID THEN OF COURSE I WOULDN'T MAKE A COMPLAINT UNTIL AFTER FINDING OUT I CANT. I would not have called 4 times if I was trying to steal a ticket from Disney. I call 4 times because they are in the wrong! I told him I had 2 friends who heard the entire conversation as well. He said that isn't enough. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED THAT DISNEY DOESN'T HAVE THE HONESTY OR INTEGRITY TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF AN EMPLOYEES MISTAKE. No exception or action could be made. My ticket was $280. This is pocket change for Disneyland. But not pocket change for me. THIS COMPANY DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS. THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT THEIR MONEY SO DO NOT BE FOOLD. WALT DISNEY DIED AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE COMPANY DIED WITH HIM YEARS AGO. I have worked in customer service before so I have a 100% understanding of situations that happen and exceptions that should be made due to company error.

8129,"This is where most of the classic rides are. For us (with small kids), it is virtually impossible to go through the whole park in 1 day. So plan accordingly and don't forget to study the FastPass system. Bring some extra clothes for the water rides. Facilites and washrooms are smaller here. Take note of the times of the shows you wish to see and the fireworks display as there might be some overlap or lack of time to run to the other. One good place to take a break from all the walking would be the Disneyland railroad.Another thing that impressed me is how they do their best to make even long lines interesting. There are many things like videos, displays, decorations, etc to distract you while waiting. Of course this isn't always successful but at least they try!Make sure to check the schedule to make sure the shows you want to see are scheduled for the day of your visit.

It used to be that the company really took pride in what it was with its guests but now they just try to gouge you out of money left and right.

8185,I am conflicted on our recent trip to Disneyland.  The park was very busy as expected but the experience was not up to Disney standards.  There was a lot of closures and construction.   What was open was in disrepair.  Some of the attitudes of the cast members was less than pleasant.   I am buying the appearance of a fairytale I would rather not listen to cast members complain about their shifts and who they don't like working with.Comparatively speaking DisneyWorld has much more to offer and we have had better experiences there.  I don't see a reason to go back to Disneyland.,3/5,4 years ago on  Google

8188,"It amazes me to see so many five star reviews for this place. Five stars suggests the place is perfect. Which it certainly is not. Arrive at 9am opening time and spend a whole hour queueing to get through bag check security and ticket check. Once inside queue in the hot sun for at least an hour for the most popular rides. Sometimes those times blow out to two hours. Two hours!! Airport Customs lines move faster than that. There are no controls in how many people they let in. People show up and the turnstiles click forward. Cha-ching.The place is heaving with people, strollers and the largest gathering of mobility scooters I have ever seen. Signage is poor as to where lines start and where to find a restroom. Food is over priced, portions meagre, and lack flavour. As for drinks, a small bottle of Coke $3.99! Really Disney? The price you charge to get in so as to get punished by the Californian sun, why so greedy with bottled liquids to keep hydrated? Word to the wise, bring a backpack with own food, snacks and drinks. And forget about the 'Magical Hour' that the park tricks people to show up at 8am on Tues and Thurs. We fell for that ploy. Made a beeline for the Stars Wars ride only to find a shouting staff member saying ""Ride closed till 9am"". New plan adopted to race on over to Matterhorn ride. Found two sullen looking crew saying ride not ready and ""Can't say when it will be ready but you're happy to wait"". And wait we did. Till 9.10am. Nice work. A 'magical hour' standing in a line. Practice for the remainder of the day. Compared to Universal Studios in Hollywood, Disneyland is a shocker. Vast majority of rides in the magical kingdom are so boring, broken down when you arrive, or actually breakdown when the park is open. Today the Stars Wars ride was offline during the morning with no explanation as to why and when it would be back online, and the log flume was closed when we had been in the queue for 30 mins. Especially nice touch by the announcer telling us to leave the ride line the way we came in with ""We appreciate your patience"". Umm, I don't think do Disney. You are trading on old products with a false belief that it is the 'happiest place on earth'. If it is so happy why are the staff not smiling and the guests look so frustrated? So dear readers if you want to waste a good deal of time and money on a pitiful and woefully inept offering, head to Disneyland without delay.

Needless to say they take it upon themselves to judge to what degree that one is disabled. The employees that I delete with were rude telling me that because I couldn't afford one of the electric scooter that( that coast$70) I must not be disabled enough. I explained to the horrible employee that I couldn't afford one of those. Then he's like well we have wheelchairs for you. I was with my niece and she is only 9 year's old and I weight 214 pounds. That was a very insensitive remark.  I'm very disappointed at Walt Disney Land. When it comes to it's not the HAPPIEST plac on Earth.

8201,"I love going to Disneyland. They're very accommodating for your needs. The staff is understanding and helpful. Please do understand that people are people. If the staff behaved in a way that you did not want then that is your problem for not being an understanding person. We all have flaws. Additionally, yes, rides do close, they break down, they have to have their Christmas decorations taken down, things happen. However, what I do know is that Disney hires the top engineers in the country to build their rides and make them work. If a ride is closed, or broken down do not get mad, keep checking back. Sure it can be disappointing but these things happen and all you can do is enjoy your day and hope that the ride starts back up soon. I have been there when rides have broken down and they get them up and running as quickly as possible. Its not as simple as pressing a button, parts may need to be changed out, something may need to be screwed back in, wires may have to be reconnected, whatever. Lastly, parades, shows, and fireworks do not happen every day. Typically only on the weekends or busier days. If it is raining, too cloudy, foggy, windy, or stormy, or even if there is some reason because of air traffic, firework shows may be cancelled. Also, the park is more crowded on the weekends. Use fastpasses and strategically plan your rides, get to the park early. Please just know that Disneyland is doing everything they can to ensure that their guests get the best experience possible.

To add on to the broken system, the fast pass line and DAS pass line are the same.  This does not work well for all persons with disabilities.

8222,"Horrible experience.  After 1hour 45 minutes in line Space Mountain broke down, they wouldn't give a reason why, but said we were welcome to wait for it to come back up.  After another 45 minutes, there was still no updates other than ""you're welcome to wait for it to start again.  The kids and I decided to go somewhere else rather than spend the rest of our time during our once in a lifetime vacation waiting for a ride that may or may not run.  (we'll never be able to do this ride because they stopped doing the promotional thing that they were doing in 2016).  During our other escapades, and long before the park closed, they began roping off roads, creating an impassable labyrinth for their parade.  I attempted to find a place to stand and watch the parade.  Every single place where there was an opening to watch the parade, a cast member would direct me away from, to a different place where a cast member would tell me I couldn't stand there, and direct me to another place in an endless loop around the parade route.  When I had completed a full lap of the route at the direction of a littany of less than curteous cast members, I attempted to simply find a side area where I could stand, and wait for the throngs of people to subside so that I could at least watch the fireworks.  While standing there, I was approached by a cast member that told me I could not stand there.  I was directed to another place where I stood until approached by yet another cast member who told me I could not stand there.  Looking in front of me, and behind me, I saw people standing stationary, I asked the cast member what they expected me to do, as there was no place other than in the marked off aisle that I could go.  I was curtly escorted to the entrance of a bathroom beside a shop between two benches upon which there were patrons conveniently standing, obstructing the view of anything other than their crotches or rear ends.  There I stood until the end of the parade, at which time people began surging out like a sea of humanity.  3 people ran their strollers into my shins and ankles, and one actually stepped inside the seat of my stroller as he passed by in an attempt to find footing among the legion of overcrowding allowed at this park.  I was able to stake out a decent spot at the back of the roped-in area to watch the fireworks.  With a decent view.  That was, until someone walked directly in front of me, put their kid on their shoulders, and there they stayed.  In an attempt to allow my daughter to get a partially obstructed view, I put her on my shoulders (which I thought was fine as I was in the back against the rope with noone behind me) until the person riding the shoulders in front of me held up an enormous tablet to record the fireworks.  My daughter and I got a decent view of the fireworks on her tablet screen, as it was literally the only way I had to view them because of our inability to move laterally from the immense overcrowding allowed at this park.Having spend $1k on tickets over 2 days and probably another $500 on food and items, I was a bit miffed when I approached several cast members to voice my concerns.  My speaking was interrupted by hand spinning, and shouting of ""the exits are this way"".  At this point I was ready to never return, however I already had tickets to go to the California park next door the next day, and decided to let them wow me on this new adventure.From the rip, this park was a disappointment.  The roller coaster broke down after 45 minutes of waiting in line.  The cast members in the ride that were directing us out of the queue began handing out tickets to skip the line because of the inconvenience.  When I got up to where they were handing them out, they stopped.  When I asked if I could have one, they simply stared at me in response as if I were speaking Latin.  I left that ride shortly after because we had reservations for a chatacter lunch (which was amazing by the way, I loved everything about it despite spending upwards of $200).

8227,"Well, where do I begin. We have been to Walt Disney World in Orlando 6x including our first time to any Disney park. This time we decided to take the trip to California to check out Star Wars Land. The two stars are pretty much just for that. The ride(millennium Falcon) was amazing, the decorations, the characters are great! Definitely worth a look if you are in the area.   The park is pretty small compared to Orlando so it's easy to see everything very quickly. Can't understand why the price is about the same for a smaller park but anyway. From the moment you arrive to try to find the parking lot is ridiculous. There are hardly signs for the park and parking lot until you are about 1/2 mile Away. The employees at the park are composed of about 80% teenager's. You can tell who they are when you see the pile of 4-6 of them talking to each other in the park. When you try asking a question or direccion, they just point the finger and hope you stop asking questions so they can get back to talking to each other. You have a better shoot asking the people that paid to be in the park for directions. Even in the rides where at Orlando, they all stay in character and do such an amazing job giving you an experience, here is unfortunately not found at all. You get one Fastpass to use at a time and you have to buy it extra with your entrance ticket. Where in Orlando, you get 3 and than one for the rest of the day at a time. Even at the stores, the employees dont seem to care at all. We were at the ice cream parlor and asked what was the most popular float, the employee look at me with a why are you asking? And than proceeded to tell me to just get whatever I wanted. Maybe I have been spoiled by Disneyworld and all the wonderful people there way too much or maybe this will help you choose Orlando over California for your experience. Either way, I'm glad that Disneyworld was our first family experience because there is really nothing like it. This really felt like what your local traveling carnival is like, a RIP off and not compared to the real thing.

We just started used those..5 of us.It was 3/8/19 a Friday.  Drove to Anaheim from Newport.  Thought the Mickey parking Garage was well managed..it's alot of cars and daunting.  Then exiting and the tram.  Ok, probably best use of mass transit on West Coast.We walked to the Monorail and entered the park next to Autopia.I will stop with the blow by blow and say we had a great day.  Using MaxPass thru Disneyland app made the day great at least until the pm hours and fast pass reservations dried up around 4 pm for the rest of the day for the top tiered attractions.We spent the extra 15.00 for MaxPass for our group members that liked rides.  We could reserve a time window for the group no matter where we were and that was worth the fee..we had a great day...PS.

I understand the park is for kids, of all ages, but could not get over the way some of them behaved while waiting in line.  What are the parents thinking when they bring a 3 year old to an amusement park?.Decided on doing the park hopper as I didn't want to pay $400 for two days, plus repeat the parking fee for the second day.  This way my wife and I saved over $100.  The souvenirs are twice as much here as they are in Disney stores throughout the country. Makes no sense.Seniors should be offered a discount.  They will not go on as many rides as the younger people and for the most part are there to walk thru the park, or accompany younger guests.  The fast pass is a terrible idea.  Disney is basically telling people that you can skip the lines if you are financially better off.At one point I was told by an employee that I could not get my picture taken with Goofy because he was going on break.  When I crossed the Main Street USA to get my picture taken with a different character, I was told the same thing.The recreating of Radiator Springs is amazing and the ride is outstanding.  I realize if I had gone during the week instead of Sunday, I would not have had to wait 45 minutes to ride it.  The food was also very good and not terribly expensive when compared to the admission fee, parking, and gift shop items.In summary, the cost of going to the two parks, (why not just make it one?), is too much for most seniors.",2/5,8 years ago on  Google

It also has entrances to Downtown Disney and even one directly into California Adventure! You save a lot of time because you don't have to wait in those crazy security lines, they do security at the hotel as you leave. PROTIP: if you take the monorail into Tomorrowland, they will ticket you there, so you can skip the whole crowd and be taken right into the park! This was my first time at Disneyland, and it was WAY more crowded than Disney World, which makes sense considering the size. I would recommend NOT going around New Years, like I did.

The entire park was over crowded with a sea of people that was a toe to toe standstill. Up to two hours plus for even the simple older children rides. Cast members with wands directing the floods of people to walk specific directions like herds of cattle. For example, I parked my stroller at the mouth of tomorrow land to ride Star Tours. After the ride, I was directed to the right and walked back to the back of tomorrow land where the floods of guests wishing to exit tomorrow land had to ""u-turn"" back to the front. Once I got to the front to get my stroller, a wanding cast member attempted to direct me back in the flow of people heading towards the back of tomorrow land. I explained I already went through the routine just to get my stroller and did not want to go back into tomorrow land. The reply was a firm ""sorry, you have to go that way."" I ultimately ignored the request in frustration and walked past her against the flow. I heard one frustrated cast member tell a guest ""will you stop talking so I can speak?"" Oh my? My little boy wanted to see Disney characters walking around the park. None were seen. Toon town was a place to get your picture with Mickey. Finally made it there with a two hour wait. Had to pass on it. The only reason I gave two stars was because the smile on my kids face when we finally made it on one of the rides. I know it was busy and I worked as one of those characters that walked around the park as a teen when it was busy. The only inconvenience back then for the guest was to wait in long lines, not herded from one place to another with a lengthy wait time just to enter the park. Disney seems to have gotten too big for its britches wanting to make the dollar over giving a joyful experience with the guest. Sadly for me, I said goodbye to a park that was once so instrumental and positive in my background that I knew I would never see again in this lifetime.

So we figure out the fast pass then go to the California screamin . Kinda confused  where the fast pass line was, so we ask a worker wearing sunglasses chatting with another worker is this the fast pass line she shakes her head and continues talking. So we're still staring at her and ask where is it. She looked annoyed and without  looking away from the employee pointed behind her and continued giggling with the employee.  Then the second employee same ride we ask which set of stares do we walk up he looks at us and then shrugs. During that day we got scolded  a few times for our tickets (park hoppers).

We told him a lot of times he could grab it take it and test it but they did not wanted to touch it. This was my FIRST time here and it was HORRIBLE. They ruined my sons 2nd bday. They discriminated us. They didn’t even gave us chance to get our parking refund back, they escorted all the way to the car, my wife was so upset (crying) she walked far from us and she got lost looking for the parking lot (like I said is our first time there) and when we were waiting for her in the car they started telling me they were going to arrest me if she didn’t get here.

Standing in line was what we experienced (3 rides in 6.5 hours) and queuing was one of the least sensory invasive times; unless you were being told endlessly that it was a rough ride, which was played at a sound level you needed to block your ears to.  At what point does Disneyland think the Park might be full?  Would it be liable if any emergency situation were to arise?  When you're queuing for disgusting toilets or just queuing to cross the road.  Where every ride has a wait time of at least 30 minutes and even when we arrived before midday the wait time for fast passes was 7.45, 8.00pm.  For anyone wanting to be able to walk freely without being shoulder to shoulder with others, this is nightmarish.

8441,"It is certainly not Disney World! We have been to Disney World multiple times and it has always been everything one would expect Disney to be and more.The park is beautifully kept, the employees are very customer centric and the overall experience is magical.And then we visited Disneyland. My daughter was so excited to meet Peter Pan. We downloaded the app, confirmed the time and place and even arrived to that speciality to be one of the first to see him. So we waited and waited and waited and guess who never showed up? That’s right Peter Pan. Now we have wasted over 1 and a half hours and have a very non magical experience to work through. Next we decided to go to it’s a small world and it was closed. What? Yes - non Peter Pan and a closed ride that showed open on the app.The park is not kept- the paint is peeling, there is gum stuck all over hand rails, the streets and stairs could use a good power washing the restrooms smell awful and are not maintained well. There were dirty floor mats rolled up and extremely visible on Main Street and trash is not picked up quickly when it is dropped. The employees in regular customer facing roles i.e. food vendors, ride attendants, photographers etc did not seem enthusiastic to be there. One employee even responded to us when asked about working at Disney he said it’s a job. To top that off we overheard a “cast member” yell at a small child that was going towards a live duck walking through the park just to pet it. Also we witnessed many people taking pictures with the amazing bouquet of balloons that are for purchase - when we asked an employee that was off in a slower area of the park if we could take my daughters picture doing the same she responded -“no I am not taking pictures today.”  We also saw multiple employees walking through the park with their personal belongings and leaving work. Never once have we seen this at Disney World.Also parents beware  unlike Disney World there is not much of a dress code required here. There were multiple inappropriate outfits such as Budweiser T-shirt’s, very revealing clothing. More like what would be allowed at an adult festival. When finally having enough of Disneyland and leaving not one cast member said goodbye or thank you.

If you plan to visit Disneyland with fastpass be aware that you can only book fast past after hour and half after first book, after that I experienced that there was none available after that due to high volume of people there and limited fastpass available. Only good thing is that you can get your pics with the maxpass.At the end of the day I don't think spending 130 dollars per ticket for only 6 rides is worth it. Not to mention 39.99 for whole pizza.

Since my mother had visitors from overseas (about 8 of them, one being disabled) we wanted to give them the experience of LA, and they also had areas that they wanted to visit; Disneyland being one of them. While we only stayed in the main park side (we forgot to visit the CA Adventure side), the highlight of the day/night was Space Mountain. My mothers friend's husband is disabled, and due to his disability, he can't ride most amusement rides (if any at all). His wife went on the ride, front seat, and when we came back to him she told him that it would be fine for him as long as he stayed on the front; an employee confirmed that the ride would be fine provided that he remain at the front. Our party member was extremely delighted, as it had been Years since he'd ridden an amusement ride, and he really really liked the ride. For his benefit -and because the employee could see the elation on his face, he was offered the chance to go again; our party member quickly agreed, hugged the employee in gratitude, and enjoyed Space Mountain for a second time.I don't think the employee knew how to handle being hugged (I don't think anyone had ever shown their gratitude in such a way) but I explained to him the circumstances of the guests elation (given that None of them spoke English) and after that, the employee said that he was also left with a fond memory of being able to provided a meaningful experience to someone who hadn't been able to enjoy amusement rides in quite some time.Thank you Space Mountain employee...and Disneyland, hire more people like him.",5/5,5 years ago on  Google

8475,"I have been to Disneyland/California Adventure 6 times over the past 20 years. I would say that I am not an expert, but experienced. Although I still like Disneyland I have found it to have steadily declined over the last 20 years; enough so that they may have finally lost my business.Disneyland is known to be a great family vacation destination. As popularity in the parks has increased so has crowd size. Not only are crowds up, but service is down. I noticed this steady decline over my last two trips. I used to consider Disneyland a place to aspire towards in the customer service realm. Workers were always cheerful and went out of the way to make my trips feel magical. This is no longer the case. There are less workers managing the day to day park and many seem unhappy, so much so that we coined the phrase, “Disneyland, might as well be at Six Flags.” Don’t get me wrong, there are still some outstanding workers there, who seem to believe in the Disney magical experience, but we had several situations where we weren’t even given eye contact while talking to a worker. We were just another customer and a hurdle to getting through their day.The lack of customer service would be more forgivable if there was at least more direction and crowd management, but with very little accountability and direction, the crowds are getting more and more rude and unruly.Along with the quickly declining customer service, the park is also in decline. When going in the past I found the park to look pristine, well taken care of and the rides to look in good repair. Now things are looking unpainted, under maintained and run down. The bathrooms were not terrible but certainly show their ware. I believe the park runs way over capacity and does not take the time to shut things down to really maintain the rides and bathrooms for the amount of ware they get. It has become too much of a money machine to take time to take care of the park.Once you get into Disneyland it used to be accessible to all classes fairly equally. Disneyland is certainly turning into a place of the haves and have nots. With the new app fast pass system, families can pay even more than the very expensive ticket price and have exclusive access to more fast passes. This means that, even though there are still fast passes available in the park many of them are being taken by families who don’t even have to go to the kiosks. Because families are now paying for these services, Disneyland is running the fast pass line very differently. There is virtually no wait. This seems great except it pushes the stand by line wait times to more unbearable wait times. I now call this the peasant line. We poor peasants have to wait while the rich get more. This is a big disappointment.Overall the theming at Disney and atmosphere is still very special, but their driving up of the ticket prices while providing a worse experience has made me question whether it is time to move on and put my family vacation money into something else more magical.",3/5,4 years ago on  Google

After attending Disney World for decades, I figured I’d buy top of the line Disney passes for my family upon moving to CA - probably worth it right?! Wrong. I’m three months in and I’m done. Here is the general 411:*Multiple rides break down during each visit*Most rides need to be updated - they look run down*Many employees do not know what is going*A handful of terrible rides taking up space*Food is just ok but pricey*No fun theme dining*Kids under 14 must be by your side at ALL times (my son waited for me on a bench for a few minutes while I got a phone charger and they took him against his will to child services - what?!) guess my teenager is coming into the women’s bathroom with me from now on!*Many employees are angry and sometimes rude crossing the line (tonight kids were running and an employee said stop running...then talking to herself in front of me and my kids said “when you slip and fall you’re going to sue us and we are not going to pay for it” - I have so many examples for sideways anger coming out from employees, very rude, inappropriate, immature and frankly - UnDisney. Which might just be the next song I wrote special for Disney and disgruntled employees with chips on their shoulders like Julianna in guest services who shouldn’t be dealing with human beings.Save your money, book a flight, a fun hotel, hit Disney World! Even if you went there once every few years it beats the heck out of season passes at a Disney theme park that doesn’t have Disney’s heart and soul. It’s too bad because there are some nice people working there, the majority are nice, but the negativity is so noticeable it just make no sense to go out of your way for a magical Disney experience that’s not really magical at all.Disney World -#1 Top notch employees there to help you have an amazingly magical time and they all genuinely mean it! You feel great being there. It’s such a positive vibes I cannot say enough about the heart and soul you feel in that attitude.#2 I have NOT ONCE had a ride break down on me there - Disneyland averages 3 to 4 a visit and you don’t get to go again - today was Indiana Jones, Space Mountain and the Storybook boat ride and they’re unapologetic about it - you cannot go again even though on IJ the Boulder never got released on the ride which was the highlight oh well. To compare, we have season passes at Universal (we really like it there) and the one time a ride got interrupted we got to go against to get the full experience. They are so nice there, they definitely care about you having a good time.3# Rides look great - the Small World dolls aren’t falling apart, interior of rides are painted and fresh, well taken care of. You don’t feel like you’re dealing with the Times Square Elmo run down, lack of quality.4# Great themed dining - really fun!5# And this is huge - I have never, not once, heard of them taking teenagers who doing fine waiting somewhere for their mom. Don’t forget to bring your male teen to the potty with you ladies - I’m sure everyone will love that!I’ve been going to Disney since I was a little kid, always Disney World, and I cannot tell you how special it is to me. It means more than rides and a mouse...it’s a magical. I tell people going to Disneyland (who have been to Disney World), do not think of it as Disney, just think if it’s a regular park, don’t expect anything special and it will be fine. But even that after this last visit isn’t good enough.When you and your family take that prescious time out of your life and spend thousands of dollars to make unforgettable memories together on a vacation and instead you get bad vibes, stress, unpredictable behavior from employees...man, I’ve given this place a handful of chances but it seems like it all goes further downhill every time we go - I don’t need it. There are better theme parks in Anaheim, Burbank, etc.",1/5,5 years ago on  Google

8482,"I have been an Annual Passholder for going on 4 years now and Disneyland never disappoints! It is a wonderful park with a large selection of rides and hidden gems. That said it is certainly not for everyone--if crowds make you uncomfortable or anxious I would avoid Disneyland during the busier seasons and aim for January through March, on a weekday if possible. To get the best possible experience I would recommend a 2 day trip to the resort allowing for a full day at Disneyland and a full day at California Adventure as switching between parks while convenient due to proximity still takes time especially near times of parades or nightly shows. Also to maximize your experience I highly recommend arriving at the property at least 20 minutes before the first park opens--the hours between opening and around 11 AM are excellent for getting in multiple rides with minimal waits so you can hit some of the bigger attractions early and prioritze shows, meals and smaller beloved attractions in the afternoon and evening. If Fireworks viewing is available near The Rivers of Tomorrow or Small World, these are excellent alternatives to the crush in the central part of the park to see the castle. The Disneyland App is an incredibly helpful tool to plan your day, and if you are a ""once in a lifetime"" or even ""once every few years"" visitor, strongly consider adding MaxPass to your ticket as it will allow you to book Fastpasses right from your phone as well as give you free digital access to PhotoPass photos which are wonderful picture opportunities with professional photographers.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

Once we finally got parked and loaded on to a bus headed to the park only to get the ride awakening of an hour wait for the security check and totally it took an hour and a half to get into the park after exiting the Toy Story Lot bus. The cast members from Security were exceptionally rude when we expressed our displeasure with the situation, especially a security officer named Marty who was the antithesis of everything Disney stands for (my wife had workedfor Disneyland). Once inside it was a mass of ride people not paying any attention to themselves or their kids. It was my 1 year olds first trip and it was certainly not the trip we pictured and I can say for certainty it will be a while before we go back.

I had already been in Disney world and loved and boy was I disgusted at this place. We went on a weekday early to avoid traffic. We sat for 1.45 hours in an underground car park. Then when we tried to get the shuttle there was a 30 minute wait. The queue for entry was 25 mins. At that stage we should have known better. I needed a drink and we went to Starbucks for a coffee and paid a fortune and again waited 30 mins to be served. At this stage we have spent almost 4 hours in the Disney ""experience "" and was exhausted. Next were the rides so we couldn't wait to see and get on. We decided we would go on a ride waited 40 mins which was fine but when we got off the place had become overcrowded. We tried to get to the haunted house to get a fast pass and it took us 20 mins to move anywhere as the crowds were that large. Kids were tired and cranky. Run  times were 90 mins and above and when we eventually got to haunted house it said come back in 4 hours.

On the other side I found California adventures a little bit more interesting they had a set up to where kids can talk with animated characters ask questions it was a lot of fun.rides are fun as well is the park set up. If you wish kids under 9 to enjoy it visit Disneyland small kids will be wowed easy there. There are rides that were fun such as Indiana Jones , pirots of the carribean the way that new Orleans was set was fun.The one thing I enjoyed was the parade and fireworks great job! When I sow it I figured where my money went :)))I will say a crowed of parents who doesn't reveal the harsh secret of the characters not being a part of how the world outside is functioning would have a blast . I would explain to my kids that the characters are just characters hired actors I don't want them to grow up with the thought when I grow up I want to be snowwhite  or sindarella  Elsa and to think they should look that way and try to strive to go for that look and not appreciate their own character or beauty .That's just me:)ticket to visit both parks at the same day is 150$.enjoy!:)",3/5,6 years ago on  Google

Best way to go is visiting early and staying over two days at least. One day for DCA and another for Disneyland. Disney's California adventure is great for older kids and teens. Be sure to use the Disneyland app for queue times and shows. Unless you have never been on it, don't ride Peter Pan with a line longer than 10 minutes. Staying in a Disney resort property is also great as you have access to extra magic hours in the morning and a special entrance through the Grand Californian to DCA.

I understand that people with passes may disagree, but surely there are more worthwhile pursuits than to spend so much of your free time at an amusement park.I would have a better view of Disney if they didn't advertise themselves as ""magical"" and of Disneyland as the ""happiest place on Earth."" The park is one like most other large amusement parks, with the addition of terrific branding and close attention to decoration.

The worest part is they have about 15 cast members in each land directing me and my family like cattle but no one picking up the trash that is littered all over the ground. Rediculous!!

They kept letting people into the park for hours after realizing that power was out and basically funneling people to areas that still had power.  This was inappropriate because only 2 or 3 areas still had power and those areas were standing room only.  Another issue is the park staff were inconsistent with their instructions and advisement.  One employee would tell you an area was closed and another would tell you an area was working.  Disneyland should also have had back power generators in a case like this.

Disneyland is also the only one that Walt Disney, the founder of Disney, worked on and stepped foot in, so some may be outdated like Autotopia, but it's history.

When it started working again there were areas of the ride that had been shut off, so we were just going through these dark areas of the ride - very strange.

Trust me on this because I’ve been there over 40 times and I haven’t been in satisfied ONCE. All though I praise Disney a lot, there are some flaws. 1: the ticket price. WAYYY too over priced. It’s like 110 dollars for 1 day ticket. Yes, it can be crowded but that’s just life for you. You have to be  patient  and I’ve seen some other reviews that it was too crowded, but you gotta deal with it. Whatever you do, DO NOT stay in one of the Disney park hotels. They are WAYYYY overpriced. You wanna stay at the DisneyLand resort hotel? That’ll be over 300 dollars a day. You want to stay in the Grand Californian Hotel And Spa? That’ll be over 200 a night. Want to stay in the Paradise Pier Hotel? That’ll be over 190 a night. The best hotel options for you is to stay at a off property hotel like the Double Tree or  Sherrington  hotel. They are right next to the park and is only about 90 or 80 bucks a night. AND it’s only less than a 5 minute drive. All in all, DisneyLand is a great vacation spot to go to and I hope you take my advice. You’ll need it if your going to the park soon! OH, and 1 more thing. Get Fastpasses for rides that are EXTREMELY popular and are always a hour or more wait. Examples are like Soarin Over The World, Space Mountain, Star Tours, Indiana Jones, And Guardians Of The Galaxy: Mission BreakOut! Last time I went on GOTG:MB, I had to wait for over 2 hours.

We arrived on Memorial Day weekend and expected insane crowds but that was not the case. Also they had Grad Nite the entire week but the parks were manageable. Our group is experienced with the Disney World crowd so large crowds at DL are easier to deal with then Magic Kingdom at capacity on Christmas Day.If you are making Disneyland or Disney World , I highly recommend doing research before heading to the parks. Read the park rules, get a better understanding of Fast Pass (Disneyland) and Fast Pass + (Disney World) - there is a huge difference. Also download the DL app for ride wait times to get a better picture and prioritize rides. For instance on Saturday we were able to ride 7 different rides before 10am, with no rushing or crazy lines.Look up restaurants to see what will require reservations (Disneyland is way easier to walk up to a seat down area , where as is Disney World you may need a 6 month reservation).We either stay on the resort (Disney World) or near the parks in this case at Disneyland. If you can hit the parks early at opening , leave around 12-2 pm.  Get fast passes for 4pm or later if possible and take a swim or nap at your hotel to rest up. Then while everyone is getting tired at the parks you come back refreshed and ready to close the parks down, I do mean stay until you are shooed out. LOL.I hope this helps any first time visitors.

As one attendant started, the FastPass simply holds your place in line. Prices have skyrocketed to where you spend a fortune trying to get into the park, a small fortune on food and then another small fortune on pictures and gifts. The stepped up security reminded me of the TSA at airports, but much nicer. They should, however, provide lockboxes for the people who are unaware of the roles, to put their multitools, pocket knives, etc. into. Some have to walk to their hotels, or make their way back to their vehicles in the parking garages, if they wish to keep their items rather than surrender them.Walt would be throwing a tizzy for what his creation has turned into.

8733,"This is a difficult place to rate because it is such a wonderful place, but It is increasingly difficult to enjoy. I have going there since the late 70s. Over the years, I have had several annual passes, and I have visited the park hundreds of times. The pricing seems to increase fairly dramatically each time I go. I don't think it was more than 10 years ago that the pricing was $59 a ticket, and now it's well over $100. I am not sure how most families can afford to go... Well, one way they are doing it, is Disneyland offers annual passes that can be paid monthly as a direct debit from your checking account; thus, more people with annual passes, more daily visitors, and less chance for a quite time at Disneyland.I used to enjoy the park so much, and I know so many of us have fond memories there... I still get hear the beckening call of ""hurry baaaack, hurry baaaack..."" from Haunted Mansion. I recall the quite evenings of annual passholders, when it was quick and easy to get on most of your favorite rides. Or the not-so-appropriate stuff we did as teenagers on the Peoplemover. Disneyland will always be fond in memories, despite the steady decline over the years.I have watched some of the best attractions, taken out for some of the worst; e.g. Country Bear Playhouse, for example. The park is far too crowded to enjoy, even on weekdays. If you are the type of person that doesn't mind being shoulder good shoulder with thousands of strangers, than perhaps it won't affect you as much. It wasn't always like this, and each year it seems to get increasingly more crowded,  and difficult to enjoy. If you do want to go, I would say the only way to enjoy this would be to stay and visit several days, otherwise you won't see very many of the attractions, due to the crowds.",3/5,6 years ago on  Google

Yes Disneyland can be pricey and crowded but if you take time to plan out your trip and our willing to stay off property you can save yourself a bundle and have more money for souvenirs. Usually we will have one to two meals at Disneyland and assorted snacks. We usually will do character dining at plaza inn which is 30 a piece but its a breakfast buffet. After eating here were full for pretty much all day this is basically our breakfast and lunch and if you look at it that way your really getting 2 meals breakfast and lunch for 30 bucks which is quite a savings for dining at Disneyland. Then we'll have a light dinner and a snack or two during the day. We also take a soft cooler that fits under our stroller and ice from our hotel and we take a dozen waters and they stay cold all day for us to enjoy.

Over time, I've lost faith in it.It becomes more and more crowded every time I come here, even during the off seasons  (doesn't anyone go to work/school anymore!?), more rides shut down which puts additional foot traffic/strain on the remaining open rides.  Also, they are tearing down or removing good attractions, yet replacing them with garbage attractions. Or, they cave to the PC scum and alter a ride to satisfy the evil ""social justice"" vermin and their insideous agenda. They are trying to ram Star Wars down our throats, yet Tomorrowland looks either stupid and outdated or just as a shill to promote Disney movies such as Star Wars or Finding Nemo/Dory/Mine-Mine-Mine-Mine....?Toon Town is a crumbling wreck, only good thing is the Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin ride, other than that forget it.The staff are rude and hateful, not to mention stupid (with certain exceptions). The food and merchandise is hideously overpriced, the place has the smell of trash or open sewers, the parades are constantly running and blocking everything up, the park not only oversells tickets, causing overcrowding, but hey also constantly shut down at 7pm for some cockamaime sponsored private event that isn't even holiday related half of the time.

The park bathrooms were not very clean and there was garbage on the ground and stuffed in the benches throughout the park. In Orlando if you saw that it would be moments before seeing an employee coming to clean it up. There were not as many photo pass photographers if any. I was not asked to get a photo taken once.",4/5,4 years ago on  Google

8742,Disneyland was and is always magical and wonderful.  My complaint lies in their cost of water (mostly) and food. It's pretty much criminal. Everyone has to drink water. The bottles are almost $5 a bottle.  I think Disney is making enough money to at least sell water at a halfway decent price. Walt would roll over in his grave if he knew how Disney Corp was taking advantage of the public.,3/5,4 years ago on  Google

8744,"We went for our little toddler so she could experience Disneyland for the first timeIf you're traveling with a toddler here are some of my notes:1. Do outside rides only (like dumbo). Any ride that has you go inside a building is too dark, loud and scary for a little one, even though they're allowed to ride it.....2. Popular toddler rides (like it's a small word) should be done in the morning3. Do breakfast with their favorite character! My girl loved meeting Minnie4. Concentrate on the entertainment and performances-there are so many great ones throughout the day.

8745,"Happiest place on earth even when it's 101 degrees. It was a record setting day for heat which was good for the lines. It kept most people away until the sun set. We live in the area and are regular Disney freaks so the only reason for being here was we were signed in by a family member. This was my first time using the Disney Maxpass found within the Disney app. This is a must feature you have to take advantage of. Couple of important things to know you have to have your tickets so they can be scanned into the Maxpass. 2nd it's going to cost you $10 for each ticket added to the Maxpass (great value). Included in the Maxpass is the ability to add pictures that are taken on most rides. At the end of the ride you can check your picture and within the picture is a number. If you have that number you can access via the app and download the picture. Without the Maxpass each picture would cost you. Disney is ridiculously clean, considering the thousands that walk through each day, it's amazing. That being said bring your handsanitizer! Food: expect to pay a fortune but it's not all bad. I recommend the Pizza Port in Fantasy Land. The portions are good, the pastas are excellent and the pizza is tasty. We always enjoy the corn dogs on Main St., chimichongas, and the turkey legs. A large part of the Disney crowd, every day, is annual pass holders who live near by. They aren't likely to attend during any adverse weather conditions be it rain or heat so I highly recommend taking advantage of these days. A little rain, take a poncho. A little heat, every piece of clothing on you should be ""dry fit"" or the like. Nothing like soggy cotton underwear.

8751,"This is a high quality venue that features the art of storytelling as an immersive experience that will be as entertaining for children as it is interesting and fun for young adults and adults. The park grounds and facilities are some of the most treasured and loved artifacts of Southern California because Disneyland is the original Disney park. Some of the things within it had never been seen before and have been mimicked thousands of times dincey and never once with the style or detail or the original.  This facility is unique in that it is smack in the middle of and part of the central street grid of now famous Anaheim Ca. You can almost as quickly be at a 7-11 or McDonalds than you could be at “it’s a small world” (a park attraction inside  Disneyland park). The operators have  made it very convenient (but expensive ) for you to be able to stay on resort property and never have to leave it for several days with no loss in creature comforts. That would be a bit unusual considering the pleathora of things to do within a mile of the park. While the operator of this park has taken great strides to see that all other Disney parks are far from the central business district of their host city’s street grid it is common place to hear guests complain about the lack of ease for them to access a non Disney venue   Remember the theme of this review is about the immersive experience (and the isolation of your dollar) and that Disneyland resort while perfectly seamless and immersive where you want it to be, Disneyland is by ar the least isolated from the rest of the world than any other Disney theme park or resort.  This park and it’s individual elements and attractions are some of the most accessible theme park attractions in the world due to a general lack of belief that such a park could ever be so popular and sought after. After a day in the resort the very need to cross Harbor Blvd can be a cold slap to the face(Disney has masked that from you all day But it is comforting to know Harbor Blvd and the adjoining street grid are still there too.It is very expensive but worth the experience an individual can expect to pay between $300-$500 in costs for a one to two day visit that is immersive only using Disney facilities and venues. It can be done bare bonesFor $200 using other choices for meals etc. For a family of 4 and up it will be a figure in the thousands of dollars.  If you want to Include total immersion in a Disney Resort Hotel you could be talking in the tens of thousands of dollars.I’d highly recommend this beloved jewel on Harbor Blvd, I’d even call you crazy to pass it up but If you are not on an millionaires budget the cost can be effectively scaled to fit your budget and you must do that before you can enjoy such a park.  If you are driving one day and see it’s nightly fireworks display on the horizon, stop,  it is not a good idea to be enticed to the front gate and into the magic without a dose of reality. Authors have been writing about the best way to get what you want out of a Disney park and I suggest you find one of these guides and do your homework first. Even the least little one hour investment of time will make such a huge difference on your experience you’ll send me candies and flowers for making the suggestion.  Mr Steve Birnbaum ( not the football player) has long ago passed away but his book Birmbaum’s Guide to Disneyland lives on this year as Birnbaum’s 2019 Guide to DIsneyland is the book you seek. (Amazon ) If you take no further action pick up a copy of this now unofficial guide and use it to help you enjoy some immersion therapy the Disney way, today",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

8778,The park is good and fun but way overpriced food so bring your own or eat beforehand. Be ready for long lines and or pay an absurd amount for a fast pass. Not low income family friendly at all.Make sure you buy more than a day if you go becuase the park is designed to make you have to come back to see everything. It's really park that will be fun but never considerate for the low income families who dont have a lot of money.The shows are amazing but their frozen live was not.Lets start by saying my kid begged for us to leave early becuase she did not like it... Frozen live was not good at all. I took my daughter who is obsessed with frozen to disney on ice this year and that was amazing. So our expectations were even greater for the real disney park. A few specific things we were offputting was the fact that Anna and Elsa are not asian in the animation so why would you cast them as such. It was like if you let kids see a Mickey show and he was no longer a mouse. The kids would be confused. My little girl said where's Anna the whole time she had no idea this girl was her. Then came the romance acting. Which was nothing like the movie. It made me so uncomfortable becuase it was really weird not ok for kids or families. Then the reindeer had a head out back...  and olaf was a man... it was as if I went to a children's high school play. It didn't feel like a disney experience at all. Disney on ice is perfect so maybe skip Disneyland frozen show and see disney on ice separately.Be prepared to always spend absurd amounts of money if you plan to spend any at all.Personally I reccomend not wanting time or money on stores and just use amazon for anything disney related you will get better deals.

I don't complain about the prices because it must cost a fortune to run that place. Everything is awesome, especially the night shows (fireworks, electric parade, world of color). The exception would be attractions (i.e. rides). My scrutiny here is two fold. First, the Fastpass line is often very long. Sometimes 3/4ths the wait of standby. That doesn't make sense to me. If it's fastpass, it should be much quicker. Like 1/4 the wait or less. It seems they over-issue fastpasses or something. I really wish they wouldn't do that. Second, I can tell they make a very concerted effort to engineer efficiency into rides in order to get people through quickly. I really appreciate that since it's probably not easy. However, in most all cases, a disney cast member has to check all the seatbelts or restraints which is often the weak link. If they cast member putts around, it significantly slows down the process. I'm sure those folks get tired of checking a billion seat belts every day but it's very obvious when they hurry it up. The line moves WAY quicker and reduces the turnover time quite a bit. It's total luck as to which rides will be quicker based on this.",4/5,5 years ago on  Google

Starting early in the morning is the key. You will get more rides done during 7:30-10 am than during the afternoon.3. Buy good memory foam shoes so you can walk relax and manage the day long walks.4. Choose your ride as per the age group ahead of time.. Check youtube. But Disney clothes from your local Disney store instead of the park. DECENT PRE WORK will save you time and money.5. Do not stretch your kids to get everything done. Get them back to relax at hotel in afternoon. After all it should be fun and not pain.6. Uber is easy to travel, cheap and fast. So spend less on hotel, stay far but try for hotel with breakfast and around food eats. Food is costly than uber. There is nothing cake walkable hotel. After 12 hours of long day your legs hurt and 10 min walk also seemd longer. So think about it.7. Do not expect to much...

I love my simple small town life,  I homeschool my children,  and don’t like popular music, popular culture or popular almost anything.   If everyone’s doing it, I’m probably not.   If EVERYone loves it, I probably don’t.  The fact that Disney is a rite of passage kinda makes me a little indignant.  I’m not a fan of the herd mentality.2.  Fairy tales are magical.  Disneyland is not.   Some things just don’t translate.  Can you convey the depth and beauty of an ancient fairy tale in a bumpy roller coaster ride with a million other people vying for the best seat?  I don’t think so.   The Cinderella story is every girls’ dream but chasing down a self-absorbed teenager in a Cinderella costume for that once in a lifetime photo is every mother’s nightmare.   Or at least this mothers’ nightmare.  There is nothing more precious than the look on the face of your children when they hear their favorite fairy tale for the first time.  That cannot be bottled up and sold for $80 in an admission ticket.  It just can’t.3.  Surprisingly, my children did not seem to be having the times of their lives either.   They were tired and crotchety and whiny just like the other eight million children there.  They wanted a $12 snack after every ride and finally (at about 2:30) said,  “Can we just go back to the hotel?”    Now THAT was music to my ears.   And while many of you may be bristling at the thought of us not getting our ‘money’s worth’,  all I could think was at least we didn’t have to pay in money AND in prolonged torture.   We were all so relieved to be done with it and back home to the real happiest place on earth.4.  In general, I’m not a fan of wall to wall human traffic,  bad coffee with powdered cream,  persistent nausea from  a day of spinning and bumping and jerking,  or corn dogs for lunch.  Go ahead and call me crazy.  As corn dogs go, however, they were pretty darn good.  And of course, it wasn’t all bad.  I can have a good time almost anywhere and I enjoyed being my family all day. The best part for me was watching the silhouette artist work her magic in less than a minute, making the most gorgeous silhouettes of my girls.  I only wish they didn’t say “Disneyland” at the bottom but I’m sure I’ll find a creative cure for that.So, Stevie and I took one for home team this week.  We high-fived each other on the way home because we’re crossing our fingers in the hopes that we’ve paid our dues to the theme park gods.  Our children won’t be able to bemoan to their psychiatrist how their parents never took them to Disneyland.  And I don’t think our kids ever suspected we were miserable.  We laughed and feigned excitement and put our best Disneyland faces forward.  I can do  anything for a day:)*************************",1/5,5 years ago on  Google

They scan your ticket and it shows everyone who is attached to the child with special needs. You tell them what ride you want to get on first and they give you a time to report to that ride. There's kiosks through out the park that you go to once you're done riding and you basically just keep choosing rides and they scan your ticket and tell you what time to report to a separate line where you just hop on.

8924,"This morning I dropped my excited son off at school. He had the opportunity to go to Disneyland with his school orchestra.  When my son got to Disneyland, he was greeted by a less than welcoming security staff member. My son, who is very respectful to his elders and far from confrontational, tried to start small talk with the security guard. The security staff cut him off and directed him to open his bag. As he searched my son's bag, he saw my son's bluetooth speaker. My son was told that he had to either take it back to the car (they arrived by bus) or hand it over to the security.  Feeling intimidated and overpowered by this already very cold demeanor of a DISNEYLAND security person ""Bradford"", my son felt like he had no choice but to hand the speaker over.  I mean what else is he supposed to do when he's 15 yrs old surrounded by friends feeling embarrassed and holding up the line. He used his authority to confiscate the speaker (which is NOT on the list of items that are not allowed in the park). What really frustrated me as a parent is the fact that the security guard didn't wait for a chaperone or an adult to be present during this process. When i was informed of what happened, I called Disneyland to speak to someone who could be helpful and help me get my son's speaker back. Let's just say, they were FAR from helpful. I have spent HOURS of my day either on hold, being transferred from one department to the next. I have been told to call different phone numbers who then tranferred me to someone else again and so on. Finally, I got to ""Guest Relations"" supposedly the higest level I could speak to. She began to inform me that I couldnt get my son's speaker back and that the only thing she could do was write down the information to ""write"" a ""complaint"" to the security department. I am so upset and frustrated that what is supposed to be the happiest place on earth has turned my day into a horrible nightmare of endless phone calls. Its more than just a speaker its the fact that someone of his athority is taking advantage of the fact that no adult was present and my son is a minor. Why not tell him to step aside or call over one of his chaperones? Its insane to believe that such a corporation is incapable of coming up with an easy solution.

They just started the Lunar New Year event on California Adventure side yesterday. Not sure if that is why the lines were so short on the Disneyland side up, 830-1030 am, 5 minutes or less wait times for Tomorrowland rides. At 1145 we had a 20 minutes or less wait times in fantasyland.  At noon we waited 10 minutes or less for Roger rabbit and the coaster in toon town. There were very many open seats at all the major dining places until 1pm. Then we crossed to California Adventure. Lots of construction happening on the pier. You cannot crossed Through from the Boardwalk side. Also, Bakery Tour is closes until Feb 2.  So we walk that area by the Lunar New Year event (the side faces the ferris wheel). That is the main section open. Midway Mania(fast pass distribution is next to world of color distribution) and Triton Carousel( both access from boardwalk) was the only ride on the ferris wheel side of the pier open. All the other rides you have to access from the Lunar new year side. The small rides by the swings, Goofy's sky school are all available. The Lunar New Year portion of the world of color is the first 5 min of the 9pm show.  The world of color is the same exact show as the august show. They have food stands from Korea, Vietnam and China wilth a few options to try. They have an Asian dressed Minnie and Mickey available for pictures. They also have free kids activities to participate in. It was quite crowded by 2pm but it was also when the performances were happening. All the Lunar New Year Suvenoirs are in the section of the pier. Gift shops only sell 2 pins for Lunar New Years. One is exclusive to Annual passholders and one is for non annual passholders. Disneyland and California Adventure are expensive(which we expected), thats why it will never get the 5th star. But we do both park with 2 kids and 2 adults with a preplanned ride strategy. We covered every ride in both parks by 4pm including lunch breaks with minimal wait time(because small kids don't have patience for all of the lines). We could have finished all Disneyland rides in 2 hrs because of the suprisingly very very short wait times yesterday we used the free fast passes only. We are too cheap to spend money on max pass. They let us bring in a kids book bag full of snacks. Even a small soft lunchbox with PB&Js. We love Disneyland and stay as long as possible to get every pennies worth out of our ticket cost. Even if we have to leave at 4pm for a nap (or find a bench to let the kids nap). Its $20 for parking at the Toy Story lot. I prefer the Toy Story lot better than the Mickey mouse lot.

8980,"Will NEVER EVER go to Disneyland again!My friend who is an annual pass holder and I went to DL for my birthday and upon entry through security she was questioned by a security guard in white about her vapor pen.The guard asked her if it was THC OR CBD she said no, its tobacco and flavored like hookah. I have those but wouldn't bring them here.  I have also brought this before on many occasions and it has never been an issue, I know to go to the designated smoking areas.He told her that she needed to get rid of it and could not bring it in and so she left to take it to the car.  He told her if he sees her smoking it, she wouldn't be allowed into DL.I watched her the entire time as she was in eyes view of everyone and knew everyone qas watching her, she's 46 and knows how to follow directions. Because who would risk their entire vacation for that. They also have cameras that don't lie.....While waiting, I witnessed the guard talking to a fellow guard laughing saying. Watch this, she isnt getting in today. This is the same guard that was pervertedly hitting on me and any other young woman coming through his station saying ""hey princess,  how are you doing today beautiful"" I mean,  I love compliments but he was really creepy and gross about it. Hitting on young women, most looking under age.As my friend attempted to come back into the park, she was stopped by 2 other security guards in blue telling her she was not allowed i to the park because the original security guard said he watched her smoking as she walked away.  I approached and told them I was watching and that he was being dishonest and told them what I had witnessed.  They wrote down all her information and told her she could not come back.  We asked them for their info and to please write it down for us and they declined to do so. They would not give us any information on them or their supervisors... meanwhile the guard in white is standing with other guards pointing and laughing at us.....We left and called the annual pass holder line and were told to go to the nearest disney resort or anywhere disney to ask for a security supervisor that would be in regular clothes, not uniform.  So we did.We were followed by at least 10 to 15 security guards and my friend was told she was trespassing and that they called the Aneheim police department to have her arrested.My friend is disabled and mentally unwell.  This caused her to have extreme psycological reactions and depression.  They ruined our entire vacation all over a lie.Upon research, we read that cigarettes and vapor pens are allowed in designated smplong areas.I WILL NEVER EVER GO TO DISNEYLAND EVER AGAIN AND I WARN EVERYONE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE HORRID AND LIARS!I will ve persuing this further as we were treated like complete criminals over a TOBACCO VAPOR PEN!",1/5,4 years ago on  Google

9002,"I have to say and I’m very sad to say this but I have talked with a lot hundreds of Disney guests and they all see what I see. Disneyland’s magic has died. It’s not the same as it used to be. I grew up at Disneyland and I’ve seen a lot of changes over the years. I’ve seen rides come and go like adventures thru interspace, the people mover, rocket rods, mission to mars, America sings to name a few. It appears Disneyland isn’t as family oriented as it used to be. I see a lot of different kind of people in Disneyland now. People that appear that shouldn’t be in the parks like really shady people with full body tattoos, gothic, body piercings, thieves, bikers those types of people. I saw two men kissing and  holding hands while in line for big thunder. One of the guys had swollen red  gums so bad, looked as if he had symptoms of HIV for real! Another time. I was in line for the haunted mansion and three men were in line sharing nude photos of naked men back and forth, making obscene, disgusting, gross gestures on their smart phones. Another incident that I can recall. The Alice and wonderland ride I have so beloved when I was a child. It is now a place where gays treat this ride as something sexual in nature and they broadcast it . We’re going down the rabbit hole!!! I heard Two gay guys yell out, while on the ride. It’s a whole new kind of people and it’s really ruining Disneyland. Its taking away from the values that Walt Disney up held. Disneyland isn’t family oriented anymore. The quality of the food has went down and the prices have sky rocketed. 11.00 for a turkey leg, 8.00 for a corn dog, $14.00 for a candy apple??? Crazy!!!! I’m so disappointed in the parks. Disneyland has lost its magic and it’s only getting worse. The parks are too crowded the lines are getting longer as the years go by. When guardians of galaxy first opened the line for the ride was almost 8 hours long. And guests were waiting. That’s insane!!!! Disneyland is the place where I grew up and it was like a second home. I no longer feel this way. Instead of Disneyland being a place of happiness it’s becoming just the opposite. I visited Disneyland 35 times one year just recently and I see the dramatic change and it’s aweful. The cast members and guests  are very rude as well., this is something I’ve never noticed before. Tomorrow land is a wreck now. The rockets are at the main entrance creating a huge traffic jam of people. The rockets need to be relocated. The people mover is gone and was used as a crowd control ride. It was awesome!! A lot people like myself miss that ride!!  Bring back the people mover !! Or at least a similar ride like it!! It’s so barren where the people mover once was. The people mover was the heartbeat of Tomorrow land, not some light show! I’m done saying what I needed to say. I’m so disappointed in Disneyland I never want to return unless great changes are made. I used to go to Disneyland every year. I haven’t been there in two years now.

Two days were ideal for us to see both parks, Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park, which conveniently share the same entrance. For a little money a park hopper pass allows visiting each park during the same day; however, we saved money by planning ahead and seeing one park each day. Another helpful tool is to install the MouseWait app and use it to gauge which attraction to visit based on the wait times submitted by users. It is not perfect, but it is close since there is no formal Disney sponsored wait time app. An advantage of the app is it can alert you to closed attractions.

9062,"Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It was the first Disney theme park.Disneyland Park￼￼The park's icon, Sleeping Beauty Castle, in 2019.SloganThe happiest place on earthLocationDisneyland Resort, 1313 Disneyland Dr, Anaheim, California, United StatesCoordinates33.81°N 117.92°WThemeFairy tales and Disney charactersOwnerDisney Parks, Experiences and Products(The Walt Disney Company)Operated byDisneyland ResortOpenedJuly 17, 1955; 65 years ago[1]Previous namesDisneyland (1955–1998)Operating seasonYear-roundWebsiteOfficial website ￼Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.[2] Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot.Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits since it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had approximately 18.6 million visits, making it the second most visited amusement park in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom, the very park it inspired.[3] According to a March 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are supported by the Disneyland Resort, including about 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent contractors or their employees).[4] Disney announced ""Project Stardust"" in 2019, which included major structural renovations to the park to account for higher attendance numbers.[5]",5/5,2 years ago on  Google

It was our first time to ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" It was awful. We went to the Disneyland Side and decided to get on the train so we could see the whole park before we decided to choose where to go. We asked the train station person if we could leave our 2 strollers and ice chest at the station since we will be returning when the train comes back. He said yes that it was fine. We got to the toon town part of the park and the train stops and we are asked to exit the train. we were told that there was a ""suspicious package"" on board and they did not know when the train will resume. so we walked to the train station to get our things. when we got there, there was a young lady in the place of the man that was there before. we saw our stuff was gone and we explained to her the situation. she stated she did not know why the man would tell us that was ok and that the security took out things to lost and found because of ice chest (which only had waters and capri suns was the suspicious package). we left the kids with my in laws to ride a ride or two and my husband and i went to the lost and found outside of the park. we waited in line for an hour and were then told that our stuff was not there that is was still in a location in side the park and that we would have to have our 2 strollers mailed to us in about a week. we tried to get back into the park and forgot our tickets with the inlaws. we explained the situation to the gate person and she then asked if we had taken pictures with our phones to prove we had been there. we told her no due to all the stuff that had happened. after another hour the manager let us in. by this time the park was about to close our kids had only went on 2 rides all day.....and we still had no items that were called a threat....the next morning we stopped by the lost and found again just to see if our items were there. they said no. my brother in law went to go ask and get information about when they might ship out items home and then they stated to him that they did have it and gave it to hime. we left and when i called disney to let them know of our experience they just said sorry that we should have known better than to leave our things.",1/5,7 years ago on  Google

It's still a fun place to go to but the cost of almost everything is ridiculous . They need to improve the cost of things. I can't imagine how it would look like with new starwarz land there.

I remember watching a clip in the early 1980's of Walt Disney's ambitions and dreams of what would become Disneyland during my orientation.

9159,"Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s.Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.[2] Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot.Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits since it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had approximately 18.6 million visits, making it the second most visited amusement park in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom.[3] According to a March 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are supported by the Disneyland Resort, including about 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent contractors or their employees).[4] Disney Announced ""Project Stardust"" in 2019, which included major structural renovations to the park to account for higher attendance numbers",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

But I also believe they allow too many fast passes for a time period, that sometimes ride lines don't move which is disappointing and hard to keep kids from whining while in line. Maybe more inline entertainment and less fast passes per time frame would help. For example we had a 90 min wait on space mountain but from when I recorded the time we didn't move up in line it was 47 minutes of being in the same place and the only reason why the line started moving was because people were getting out of line.

We will stick to Disney World in Florida.",2/5,4 years ago on  Google

9230,"I would give a 5 star but there were 2 things that I experienced at Disneyland that I did NOT like.  The first is this is NOT a smoke free park.  The designated smoking areas happen to be extremely close to the walk paths.  So if you and your babies are walking from one part of the park to another you are guaranteed to find yourself waking through a cloud of cigarette smoke at some point during your visit.  Another is Disneyland can afford to work on the way they have handle the whole situation of taking pictures with the Disney characters.  For example my four year old spotted Mickey from across the French court yard which was literallly a yard away and when we approached Mickey so my son could meet him we were met with the employees telling us that Mickey was no longer accepting pictures. Really???  Try explaining to a 4 year old they cant say hi or shake Mickey's hand,  whome is less than 1 foot away and they have to turn around and watch Mickey watch them leave! It was horrible! So Disneyland is a great place but their rules and the way their employees handle certain situations is NOT ok.",4/5,3 years ago on  Google

So I can't comment from the fan point of view being that I feel bad it's sort of grown away from me. But from the point of view of a well-run business beautifully and naturally maintain year after year, where they are printing money daily with a Big sound stage in the middle of Anaheim...And this is the mother ship of all that is Disney, you need to go at least one time.

There are times in Disneyland when you begin to forget about the drudgeries of mundane life and just when you're ready to give yourself over to the rhetoric of the Happiest Place on Earth, someone will run straight into you with a stroller improbably filled with purses while looking behind them and screaming at their spouse.The key to enjoying Disneyland is to divide the rides into two types: rides with lines longer than 30 minutes and rides with lines 30 minutes or less. You should prioritize picking up a fast pass for the rides with long lines and then wait in shorter lines while you wait for your appointed fast pass time.Also, if you're planning on dinner in the park, make a reservation at one of their restaurants with the Disneyland app; it will make your life much easier and you'll be able to eat some pretty good food rather than typical amusement park fare.",5/5,6 years ago on  Google

Sad but true.We all know how expensive is to get into the park and the prices one pays for a bottle of water, $ 4.50 for a fruit bar that cost 99 cents for the whole box at the 99 cents store..My point is, that the park is  about money, money. They treat you as a second class citizens if you do not pay the fast pass price..we were heading to the Mark Twain boat and we were told that it was down for the day..they did not ask us if we held the fast pass tickets, but they judged us for our looks, I guess we looked too indigent or too brown to pay for the fast price. To my surprise, later on I saw people  boarding the boat but there was a big sign saying:"" Reserved,  only for the fast pass guests"" wow!,For the shows, and the parades they blocked the areas, and the attendants that acted like Nazis in concentrations  camps, tell you that they are for the fast pass guests.We took my 2 year old granddaughter, she enjoyed it tremendously, but if you are planning to go to Disneyland you better buy the expensive tickets and keep making Dysney the richer evil empire.Make sure that you know what the  fast pass tickets means.👎",1/5,4 years ago on  Google

9252,"Growing up in the 60's Disneyland was magical in so many ways.  Walt Disney Disney special care to make everyone who visited the park, leave having enjoyed the most enchanting place on the planet.  Slowly,  but surely,  since Walt's death,  the corporation has cut costs in ways that have slowly taken the magic out of the Magic Kingdom. At one time,  we were season pass holders,  but the cost is prohibitive,  especially considering that although the park looks like it once did,  it just isn't the same place it once was.  Cast members were so friendly when I was growing up,  some still are,  but some today are rude,  something which never would have happened when Walt was alive.  The park is overcrowded every day and it effects everyone who visits and all the cast members too. I I'm now the reason I had continued to visit the park year after year into my adult life was to try and recapture the magic from our childhood,  but it just isn't the same.  The park isn't as clean as it always was and many other small aspects of what made the Kingdom magical have somehow been tarnished.  The good news is that I will always have my memories from my childhood and for that I'm grateful to the vision Walt Disney  had, and that he shared it with us all.",1/5,4 years ago on  Google
9253,"I was in Anaheim in April 2015 for a Star Wars convention. Celebration lasted four days, leaving us with some free days before we had to fly back home. Naturally Disneyland is the best choice to not only fill the time, but to experience something special! Coming from a city that boasts a few theme parks, we were braced for the crowds and the pricing, but again: it's Disney! I purchased the tickets from the hotel, and caught the shuttle to the park. We got there early enough that we forgot about grabbing breakfast at the hotel and actually ended up eating at the park that morning and afternoon. The novelty was definatly strong; everything was either Mickey shaped or had a punny name. (both of us being in our 20s and with no kids, I found the food experience WAY more entertaining than he did). All and all, we were able to ride all the staple rides, pick up all the standard souviners for all of the assorted family members, and take all the cheesey pictures we wanted. It was an amazing trip, and I feel my only regret was spending just one day there. Sure, we spent some time waiting to ride star tours for the third time, and we never used the fast pass, but the longest we stood around was maybe 20ish minutes (and I'm pretty sure that was for the safari ride, cause the haunted mansion and Pirates moved pretty quick).My brother went shortly before I did with a gaggle of kids and cousins, and I certainly applaud those tenacious families. Disney is not for the faint of heart! But like any trip, good planning and budgeting will save a lot of headache. (seriously, you go during any major school break expecting everything to be easy, you're insane.)Disney is something everyone should experience multiple times thoughout ones life: It brings the wonderment of childhood back, and it reminds us that the magic never truely dies.",5/5,7 years ago on  Google

Disneyland is known as ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" where all your dreams will come true. This is true.. unless you are an adult male then the happiest place on earth would be the Playboy Mansion. Don't worry boys and girls, you won't understand now, but when you are older you will understand. Mr Hefner and his house full of bunnies.Disneyland is still fun even if you are an adult, as long as you still have an imagination. It will not be as impressive as when you were a kid, but still a fun theme park. The return of the Captain EO Tribute! This is an awesome experience. No matter what your views of Michael Jackson this is a must see. It was much better than the Honey I shrunk the audience crap! Besides most kids these days were not born when Captain EO or Honey I shrunk the kids came out. Disneyland is still a great theme park for the season pass holder. California Adventure's is MEH if you live in California. If you are from out of state or country than it maybe worth checking out, but I would recommend Universal Studios in Hollywood instead.PROS (must do): The best time to go to Disneyland when it rains! I went on a day that it ""may"" rain. Park was empty and I could ride anything at anytime. I rode space mountain 5 times in a row without getting up.-Food is pretty bad, but I suggest trying the Pizza Rocket place. Its cheap and you can't mess up pasta. I also heard good things about the bbq AYCE place.-Take full advantage of FASTPASS! If you are like me, grab as many as you can and time your rides perfectly. Go to the busiest rides first. You can only get one at a time *per hour period. So get the latest pass first. Example, get a 7pm pass first (Indian Jones, Splash Mountain, etc) then get a 2pm pass next. If you get the 2pm first you will not be allowed to get the 7pm, because you are currently holding a pass for 2pm.-Watch shows and Tomorrow Land when the day is hottest.-Best time to ride the most popular rides within 1-3 hours of opening or closing.-*Secret. Best place to watch the fireworks! In front of the park in between CA Adventures. The entrance is the best place to watch, because it isn't very crowded and you can SEE! Plus, if you have a stroller or want to go home after you can run to the trams before the mass herd does.-Space Mountain, Captain EO, Indiana Jones, Thunder Mountain-Take the train or monorail if you get tired.-Free visit on your Birthday.CONS (avoid): Randomly rides will be shut down or under repair. (Even peak time Summer!)-Kids, strollers, and diaper smells.-Foods not great-Shows are better quality at California Adventure.-Lines and people-Parking is a freaking rip $15. I understanding raising sometimes, but it was $14 beginning of summer. (I'm not cheap, but we are already going to throw away a lot of money once in the park)Summary. If you are ride person like me, you may like Knott's or universal studios. Great place for kids of course. If you want a fun weekend and don't want to drive far. Disneyland is just a great place to go an relax. Try to go on a weekday or during off peak.

9304,"I went with my wife and son and we found the opportunity to meet Darth Vader in the Star Wars exhibit.  It felt like the character actually walked out of the Star Wars movie and was breathing like Darth Vader and was talking just like him.  Darth Vader is truly is an intimidating and imposing personality.  The Star Wars exhibit also had characters like Kylo Ren and Chewbacca whom we met during our last visit.  The artwork is phenomenal and was reasonably priced for the quality of the work.   As for Disneyland, it is 99.9% perfect and clean, but there were a few things that need attention.  For example, the crowds are increasing day by day and the Pixar Fest was a magnet for huge crowds.  Thankfully, the fast pass option really helped us to organize our day and avoid waiting in standby lines for hours.

No matter where you are, you never get a glimpse of the outside world, so it always feels like you're in a different world. You go to bugs land and the buildings look like giant juice boxes, you go to Tomorrowland and you have just stepped into the future, you go into Frontierland and you have taken a step back in time. Everything in Disneyland is made to please the consumer. The food is fairly inexpensive as long as you stay away from snacks and buying drinks. The merchandise is also reasonably priced. There is something for absolutely everyone here and it is the perfect place to go and just get away from life.

And its true that no matter how old you are, if your 80 or 39, your always a kid here. Everyone has fun here, tho the prices are really rough. I plan to go here in september for 2 days both parks... Disneyland is truly The Happiest Place on Earth(and there are 6 parks around the world).I went here and it felt I stepped into another world. Like a portal when you walk through the turnstiles. I felt confident in riding everything and I did. I had fun. I got lost when I was 10 and  thank god for apple making the find my friends app and I was back with my family before I knew it. Dismeyland is many many different things. But if youve never been to disneyland. Then youve never truly lived. Disneyland is magical. In disney world. The main disney world resorts connected to monorail or disney bus allow you to unlock your room by using your ""magicband"". And they added a new disney park in shanghai. Maybe theyll add one in SF.Disneyland changed my life. The first time I went here in 2007 I was so happy but back then I didnt know what disneyland was. But when I got an iphone, I looked it up and started to learn more than I knew. I ate at goofys kitchen and minnies cafe. And I loved the mickey chaped waffles and the minnie head decorated resturant. And the disney monorail themed waterslides, the park-themed towers, and the 3 convenient resorts. I once stayed at The Grand Californian Resort and Spa, and walked straight into California Adventure. They have a private entrance for hotel guests to use to get into the park. And a private pool for hotel guests to watch the fireworks and World of Color at night.If you havent been to disneyland or disney world dont worry, they always post deals on resorts and flights every special season like christmas or thanksgiving. once all of my relatives, which is about 20 people, went to disneyland all together and stayed at the disneyland hotel. We had so much fun and i would reccommend it to famalies with small children and kids. Its very friendly to kids and all ages. But there are secrets that the park doesnt want visitors to know, like that some rides are haunted but some people wont believe it but i do. I wouldnt pass up the oppurtonity to go here again and again and again until I die.There are some Disney quotes that stuck with me throughout school and will be with me forevermore. “Keep moving forward” indicates that whatever you do wether it’s wrong or close to being right, you always start over and “try try again”. “All your dreams will come true if you have the courage to pursue them” what  this means to me, is that “if you can dream it; you can do it”, by that I mean if you have so much courage your fearless and “wishing upon a star”, then you’ll pursue your dreams of becoming anything you want to be (realistically). And there are more powerful Disney quotes that we all love, but in order to know if they’re true, you’d have to go there yourself to see its “beauty”...Walt had many dream and so does everyone else; and in his lifetime, he saw them come true. And so will we(in the/a near future).“All your dreams will come true if you have the courage to pursue them” -Walt Disney“If you can dream it; you can do it”... this means that if you can truly dream your dream or future, it will come true someday. Miracles happen. Just wait and you will see. Walt created Disneyland for a reason; to make peoples lives more enjoyable and influence them with imagination and feeling young again.

9380,"Look, this is not to bash on Walt, the cleanliness of the park, the employees, the actual ""love"" of Disneyland. It's truly boiling down to the cost of it all, for this review.Disneyland is small. That's not an issue to me, but when you actually look at the layout of Disneyland it's fairly tiny. It's the illusion of waiting 30 minutes, to ride a 2 minute ride that is why it appears to look so big. We were done walking the entire park in about an hour, if you go on a non crowded hour. I say hour because there is no such thing as a non crowded day here anymore (doesn't anyone go to work or to school anymore!?).Another problem is, if you don't have the luxury or the luck to go on a non crowded day during Disneyland's calendar designated low crowd day (assuming they still exist), then you'll be waiting/suffering in extremely hot weather, possibly with screaming/crying children (and if they aren't yours, then you'll be hearing someone else's) and all of that will be for a 5 minutes or less long ride!The cost to get into ONE side of Disneyland's theme park is roughly $100. If you think that sucks, anything you BUY in Disneyland (food, bubble wand, mouse ears, ice cream) is going to cost you. For example, you would pay $20 for a bubble wand. Only ONE! And if you bring two children, there goes $40! And you might say ""why would someone buy that?""...fact is, people in general don't spend $400+ to come to Disneyland and not get a $400+ experience. They're  not about to pack a peanut butter jelly sandwich, when they've literally spent over a thousand dollars on a Disney vacation. In for a penny, in for a pound, 'aye?In conclusion...it's not worth it [anymore]. I love Disneyland but I do not love how Disneyland takes the happy right out of your wallet and turns it into the biggest expense and an exhaustive ordeal. I don't know about you, but I don't feel like standing in line for 30+ minutes (with or without) kids..paying $5 for an ice cream bar or any snack/beverage...$25 or more for a souvenir and then hearing the kids say ""where's Cars land?!"" Oh that's right...it's on the OTHER side of the park, California adventure..can't get in...without spending another $400!Side note, kids 2 and under are free. They should change that to 3 and under because many 3 year old kids are too short for most of the rides and should not have been charged full price (in my own personal opinion). Also, to the people who say ""don't bring a baby, they are too young to enjoy it!!"" Well, first of all, my friend's 9 month old had a WAY better, more enjoyable time. She did not make a peep and looked around in awe of all the lights and the rides! It was her older kids who were completely drained of waiting and were not enthralled to say the least.I love Disney but God almighty, Disneyland and moderately priced do not go together. Someone needs to put a cap on how many people can enter the park, the lines and crowds are WAY too long and horrendous for anyone, let alone children!  Plus, the prices have really skyrocketed in just 10 years.Also, the Disney corporation has committed many cardinal sins that they should NEVER have done, such as resting/riding on their laurels, contributing to the zeitgeist, and losing their common touch. They abuse their employees, treat their guests/customers as numbers, not people...and overall they are now a runaway corporate sh!tstorm.",3/5,5 years ago on  Google

Once we were in the parks things were OK, however, simply getting into one of the parks is simply no longer worth the time.

9429,"Disneyland, you bring back old memories....I haven't been to Disneyland since before they added Capt. Jack Sparrow to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was with great anticipation that I visited the hallowed streets of Disney once again.I managed to ride all the major attractions, other than Splash Mountain, in a day (10ish to 7:30ish)-Star Tours - Awesome!  I thought that the use of CGI would cheapen the ride, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Our scenario was Darth Vader stops us before departing to search for a spy.  We try to escape but he uses Force Hold to keep us.  Our ship fires lasers at him and off we go.  Quick jump to light speed and then we're in Chewbacca's homeworld.  Another jump, and we're in a battle between Imperial star destroyers and the Rebel Fleet.  Another environment was on the screen, but I don't recall what it was.  Then another jump to light speed, we're in another space firefight between Episode II ships.  I didn't know Star Tours can go back in time?  Last, we were in Coruscant evading oncoming traffic.  Great ride, and a must to ridePirates of the Caribbean - Nostalgia at it's best.  Capt. Jack is seen a total of 3 times during the ride & there was a new light show of a pirate (was it Barbossa?) on a smoke screen that the boat passes through.  The Capt. Jack robots really have a striking resemblance to Johnny Depp.  Another must ride.Haunted Mansion - Classic ride.  No thrills, no drops, no bunny hops or hairpin turns.  Just childhood fun.  Great place to cool-off, too.Disney Railroad - This is good when you want to chill for awhile and/or need a transport to another part of the park.It's a Small World -  Hate it or love it.  There is no gray area regarding this ride.Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage -  I actually dug this ride.  At first, I thought the sub would pass by submerged, cheap mannequins of Nemo & his pals but it actually had CGI of the cast of characters with some mannequins of anglerfish.  As usual, the subs were kinda cramped but, all in all, cool ride.Autopia - It's nice to ride without having the cops coming after you.  The car in front of me stalled 4 times.  I don't know if it was running low on gas, or maybe it's a Ford? (LoL)Great Moments w/Mr. Lincoln - Cool historical attraction.  It felt like the Fourth of July all over again.  Nice to check out at least once.Space Mountain - My favorite ride, at Disneyland and perhaps at any amusement park.  Halfway through the line, and we were told that the ride was broke & we could wait until it's fixed, but they didn't have a time table or knew if it would be fixed.  Am I leaving?  Heck naw!  I waited and, sure enough, in 15 mins the ride was operational again.  Darkness adds to the ambiance.  I love the tight turns, the bunny hops, the spacy techno music.  This is the piece de resistance.  Must ride?  Abso-freaking-lutely!Indian Jones Adventure - I used the single-rider line and managed to get on the ride in less than 20 mins.  I have a love/hate relationship with this ride.  I love the special effects and when the jeep goes full throttle.  I hate the whiplash inducing start/stops.  I'm glad I managed to squeeze it in in less than 20 mins, but I'm still trying to figure out whether I like the ride or not.It seemed like there were more strollers than people at Disneyland, and there were tons of people.  Strollers were everywhere, no understatement here.  I personally think kids should go to Disneyland for the first time when they're 4 or 5.  They can walk and enjoy most of the rides, but that's me.I had a blast at Disneyland.  I brought food & water into the park, so I saved a bunch of dough.  The only souvenirs I got were the 2 fortune cards from Esmeralda, the fortune teller machine located in Main Street USA.  I definitely recommend visiting Disneyland, but you may want to go on ""off"" days to avoid the masses.",4/5,7 years ago on  Google
9430,"Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABCTelevision Network on July 17, 1955.",5/5,3 years ago on  Google

9433,"I always have a great time here! Take advantage of the fast passes(they are free)! I would suggest doing the popular rides first of you are there at opening or extra magic hour: Peter Pan, Space Mountain, Star Tours, Haunted Mansion (especially during the holidays). If you are there with kids, do what they want to do first i.e. Princess/Character meetings, Toon Town(they close early anyway). If you MUST meet Mickey and Minnie at their house, the wait will be at least an hour! Don't be fooled by the 30min posting. Otherwise, catch them on Main Street 😊 If you want to see the parade, no need to wait hours for it. Just ask your local Cast Member where the best spot would be for your little ones to see it, and ask how far in advance would you suggest waiting. I usually get a spot 15-30 mins before and always get a great spot.

9440,"The most happiest place in the world? I need to put the theory to test so I was dragged to Disneyland by my gf that swore it is the best place ever. We will see about that! So before you continue any further,  know that Disneyland is home of the most longest wait times out of any theme park in the world and rightfully so! So even if it might be expensive, if your time is valuable to you and you hate waiting in lines, purchase fast passes which will bestow you the magical power to cut the long lines!When you arrive to Disneyland, you will first have to park and then before you take the tram you will have to go through the security checkpoint which they check your bags. Awesome thing about Disney is that they don't care if you have water, food, sandwiches or even a whole turkey in your bag. They only prohibit weapons, selfies stick or anything that is deemed dangerous. So keep your family katana at home!After you go through the security checkpoint, you'll have to wait to grab the tram and no you can't walk to the park. This will take you to Downtown Disney which is right next to the entrance to Disneyland or Disney adventure. For this review, we will head over to Disneyland! Once you enter you will see various photographers taking pictures that will give you a photo pass that you can use during your entire Disney trip!You'll walk around and come to main street which stores are scattered throughout the street.  You have a couple things you can do at the park, go the the many restaurants scattered throughout, character meets, rides.For rides, you need to make it the most popular rides first which are space mountain, Matterhorn, splash mountain, nightmare before Christmas mansion, it's a small world, Indiana Jones, Roger Rabbit's toon car, Big Thunder Railroad. The bad news is that they are scattered throughout the park so you can only walk so fast. If you haven't, I'd recommend the Fast Pass because this will make wait times meaningless. Then after you finished the big rides, you can finish up with the small ones like Peter Pan, Pinochio, Buss light year, Star Tours etc. You can get all this done in a day with the Fast Pass and arriving for Magic Morning Hour which grants you access to the park one hour early. We used the Max Pass on our phone, doing smaller rides while reserving the popular rides so we didn't have to wait i line for those!Character meets are pretty fun and usually they are extremely fast. Besides the fact that they show up random times in random places, there are some  that are only available for 15 minutes where some are available for a good part of the day. Make sure to check the Disneyland app where they will tell you when and where characters will pop up. I'd suggest hitting minnie and mickey's house as the wait times for these are 30-45 minutes at peak wait times. Also please supervise your kids during these meets. I saw several children hitting and pushing the characters while the parents just stood and watched. Shame Shame ShameNow to eat, there are several restaurants on main street and New Orleans. I highly recommend go to Cafe New Orleans which you will have to make a reservation way before hand but let me tell you it's worth it! It will be expensive but I would recommend getting the three cheese Monte Cristo, Pomme fries! They also have a pineapple Dole whip by the Tiki room! Also Beignets and corn chowder is SO worth it!Shops are scattered throughout the park where they focus on the rides in which they are right next to. They have the Halloween store, Pirates, mad hatter, and then the shops on main street is something you WON'T want to miss. There are several places to shop and you might end up walking with a lighter wallet!They also have parades and random entertainment scattered throughout the park so refer to your app or map. The fireworks is really popular which you can see from around the park. The Tinkerbell firework is only view able to guests in front of the castle! There is also the Fantasia show which is where New Orleans is.",5/5,5 years ago on  Google

So that's why you have to do Disneyland in a smart way. To save money, bring empty water bottles and fill up at drinking fountains, bring in snacks (when permitted), eat meals in downtown Disney (cheaper than in the park). Save time by utilizing their FastPasses and single rider lines for the super busy rides. Make sure you leave time for the adventure of Disneyland and all the wonderful shows.

In 3 days we enjoyed eating churros, flaming hot dogs, pizza, Jack Jack num-nums and dinner at Flo's Cafe; but the off-site restaurants and hotels within walking distance made this trip more affordable.

In fact the lack of pedestrian access around the park is so troubling, I wonder how you could safely extradite yourself in case of an emergency.

The sales office representative Bonnie should be fired and I don’tExactly understand the role of her supervisor Rachel. As neither did anything and where extremely rude.  The next negative was I paid in advance for dinner at Goodys kitchen and made reservations Ans when we arrived at the Disneyland resort the host had no recorded of the reservation though I had screenshoots once again of it being reserved. We where defiantly disappointed as we did no Christmas shopping as this trip was our #1 gift. Reuined by incorrect communication from Disneyland and no efforts to correct the errors.

I always have fun when I go with my disneyland passport. I get discounts on food and merchandise and I get free parking.  The best time to go is during the week during school days but in the summer you can't really avoid the crowds. Best place to eat is definitely the Plaza Inn they have an amazing three piece fried Chicken meal served with mashed potatoes, buttermilk biscuit and veggies all for $17 which I know sounds pricey but at disneyland this is a deal! lol",5/5,4 years ago on  Google

I just feel like because we were not a couple of thousand dollar customer that they could care less about us.

He went on Finding Nemo and calmed down afterwards. Talk about a nightmare. Besides that, Disneyland has great attractions, great food, great everything, I went on at least.......hmmmmm......let me see.......my memory is a bit rusty.......oh I remember now. I went on a total of 11 rides. The Disneyland Railroad, Splash Mountain, Matterhorn, Haunted Mansion, Star Tours, Space Mountain (Sorry, Hyperspace Mountian since that's what it's called now), Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom, Pirates Of The Caribbean, Disneyland Jungle Cruise, Astro Launchers, and Ugh......can't believe I'm saying this because I'm a guy......but, Snow White's Adventure. Yes I said it......I rode on Snow White's Adventure too. So sue me! I really don't care, because I only rode it because my sister wanted to. Anyways the rides are awesome. Age to me doesn't really matter. I will always feel nostalgia everytime I go through those gates and enter the magic kingdom of Disneyland Anaheim. To me Disneyland Anaheim is the original magic kingdom and nothing else can replace its beauty, magic, and glory. I love Disneyland. I'm super excited about the third sister park being opened right next to Disneyland and California Adventure. No spoilers! I won't say what the park is. Only that the sister park will fill people with even more nostalgia. The food was awesome at Disneyland by the way. Good everything. I especially love the deserts they serve there. Can't wait to go back in January next year. This time I'll film it. I'll always talk to as many mascots as I can. Anyways thanks for always being such a great park Disneyland. To Disney Co if this read this review, thanks for bringing us the magic and beauty of Disney. If Walt were alive right now he'd be very proud of what his company has become. 😁 Good luck with future Disney projects. I'll be back to visit Disneyland very soon. See you around. 💖💓💗💕💞❤️🌟⭐️✨💫🌠🎆🎇💥🎉🎊🎈Just went to Disneyland 1-25-17. It was even more amazing than usual. The rides were updated and beautifully colored. Magic was everywhere. I even got to see the Disneyland Electrical Parade for the very first time. Everything was so colorful. So full of magic and life. Even the food was awesome! Good service! Very nice workers there.

I'm personally sickened by their behavior and the behavior they condone. so it was my moms birthday. She can't go to disneyland often because she hurts too much. She can't walk for very far distances due to her really bad arthritis. So for her birthday I told her we will get her a scooter for her and we will go to disneyland! We had a pretty good day but using those scooters at disneyland is HELL! People ALWAYs cut you off and then get mad at you for being in their way.                                               Well anyways, our last ride of the night was going to be haunted mansion. There is a very small aisle for you to go down when you have a wheelchair/scooter and my mom was going down it to get on the ride and a kid in the line right next to her was playing on the ropes swinging and then put her foot out right in front of my mom and my mom ACCIDENTALLY hit the kids leg. My mom stopped and apologized and asked if the kid was ok. The dad/grandpa or whoever that was with her went off of my mom. Told her she is disgusting and he just kept yelling at her. Obviously he has a severe issie with fat people riding in wheelchairs at disneyland like ALOT of people do and called her a pig and that she is disgusting. So I went off on him telling him not to talk to women that way and he is disgusting. The guy made a HUUUUGE deal about it, got out of line and said he needed to take his daughter to the nurse. He had security called and all this stuff. Security treated my mom and me like we were kid killers or something.  We told them our side of the story. I have no clue what the other guy was telling them but they were not letting us leave. They told us we can not leave because we injured someone. They told us to exchange information with the man. I said no way. I will not give the guy who has been yelling at my mom our information. They said we cant leave until they get things figured out. It was also VERY COLD. So I finally told them I am calling the cops and they told me that they already called the cops but i went on to look up the anaheim police dept on my phone and then all of a sudden they told us that they can not hold us there and that we can leave if we want to. So we left. They had a security guard follow us ALL the way outside of the park. Watched us return her scooter and then went and talked to them probably to get information on my mom or whatever. They treated us like we were horrible criminals when in fact this was all DISNEY's FAULT! they have the tiniest lines to try and get these big scooters through. Just the way they treated my mom and I made me sick. My poor mom is totally freaking out now thinking they are going to come arrest her for leaving or something. Shes now having severe anxiety attacks and quite frankly so am I about this whole crazy situation. They completely ruined my moms 55th birthday by treating us like criminals. My mom did not mean to hit the girls leg. she apologized and wanted to make sure the girl was ok but the dad had a huge revengeful agenda up his sleeve. Whatever he was going through - he took it ALL out on my mom and disney just totally went along with it. Its so sad. Disney hurt me beyond repair and I was well - one of their biggest fans. This just hurts. I dont even know if we can go back to the park or whatever since they followed us out of the park.",1/5,6 years ago on  Google

It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It is the oldest Disney Park in the world.Disneyland Park￼￼The park's icon, Sleeping Beauty Castle, in 2019.SloganThe happiest place on earthLocationDisneyland Resort, 1313 Disneyland Dr, Anaheim, California, United StatesCoordinates33.81°N 117.92°WThemeFairy tales and Disney charactersOwnerDisney Parks, Experiences and Products(The Walt Disney Company)Operated byDisneyland ResortOpenedJuly 17, 1955; 64 years ago[1]Previous namesDisneyland (1955–1998)Operating seasonYear-roundWebsiteOfficial website ￼StatusOperatingWalt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.[2] Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot.Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits since it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had approximately 18.6 million visits, making it the second most visited amusement park in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom, the very park it inspired.[3] According to a March 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are supported by the Disneyland Resort, including about 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent contractors or their employees).[4] Disney announced ""Project Stardust"" in 2019, which included major structural renovations to the park to account for higher attendance numbers.[5]HistoryOriginal dedicationTo all who come to this happy place: Welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future.

Disney, July 17, 1955[6][7][8][9]20th centuryOrigins￼Walt Disney (center) showing Orange County officials plans for Disneyland's layout, December 1954The concept for Disneyland began when Walt Disney was visiting Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his daughters Diane and Sharon. While watching them ride the merry-go-round, he came up with the idea of a place where adults and their children could go and have fun together, though his dream lay dormant for many years.[10] He may have also been influenced by his father's memories of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago (his father worked at the Exposition). The Midway Plaisance there included a set of attractions representing various countries from around the world and others representing various periods of man; it also included many rides including the first Ferris wheel, a ""sky"" ride, a passenger train that circled the perimeter, and a Wild West Show.

The closest competition is Universal Studios, but only because not the Harry Potter land shot up its theme game.

You can use to find out wait times on rides (letting you plan out which rides to use Fast Passes on), order meals from select casual restaurants (including special dietary needs), and to make meal reservations at select table service restaurants.There was a standout cast member on our visit - Maynard at the Enchanted Tiki Room. He was by far the best 'host' of the Tiki Room that I have ever seen, at Disneyland or the Magic Kingdom at Disney World.

A reputation know world wide. How disappointing to see a total disregard/disrespect for the 'Disney"" image. Walt never intended for""his"" cast members to look like ""slobs"", unkempt, with over done makeup and messy hair! This lack of care (perhaps knowledge) toward personal appearance, is reflected in the cast members interaction with guests! Oh, how the mighty have fallen.",1/5,4 years ago on  Google

9769,"My VERY FIRST trip to ""The Happiest Land on Earth."" I was just over three and had just gotten over meningitis and this was kind of a ""reward"" for still being alive.  It would have been in 1955.  We had been watching the construction of Disneyland on our little 12"" Black & White TV for what seemed like years, to me.  And every Sunday when the show was over I would always be found making sure that we were going.  ""We're going?  Right?  Right?  We're going, right?""  This is when they started calling me ""HARD HEADED.""  A description that I still carry.  The long drive from Redding was tedious for a small child.  But it was exciting too.  Imagine driving 570 + miles, today it's only about 8.5 hours.  Now, think about how long it would take with NO FREEWAYS!  When we drove from my Uncle Johnny's house in Gardena, to THE PARK my face was glued to the window for my first sight.  Then it happened.  Sleeping Beauty Castle.  At the time the highest point in THE PARK.  The smile on my face lasted a week, and I can still bring it back with just a thought.  It was just the beginning Of ""A Beautiful Friendship!""  I would be returning to Disneyland many more times.  In fact, I probably averaged about once a year.  Until my last birthday 3 Jul 2015.  My caregiver and I spent 3 days. Before the trip I thought it may be my last.  Even in a power chair it was very hard, time and tiring and when the trip was over I knew that I would never be able to come back.  But, we had a GREAT trip Walt and I.  More of the story later.  I'm looking forward to posting the photos I still have at hand and telling my side of the Walt/BillFritz Story. ;-) :-)",5/5,6 years ago on  Google

Small updates to space mountain (now Hyperspace Mountain), Star Tours and tomorrowland in general really the it into the entire Disney experience. Disney's California Adventure, while still fun is not quite as cohesive. Cars land and Pixar Pier are the most successful theme. Guardians of the Galaxy, the Avengers (show), and Monster's Inc.

Now that they have professional picture takers, maxpass, and the ability to order food through the app, the experience is still managable in a flow of people.  Out of all the themeparks, Disneyland really does remove you from your daily life and give you that special place that takes you into a fantasy land.

9804,"It's Disneyland, so if you enjoy Disney things or have children, you should enjoy this place every time.  I'm a passholder, and here's a few recommendations:1.  Bring warm(er) clothes for the evening.  It's not unusual for the temp to drop 20+ degrees as the sun sets, and some of the night time shows can get you wet2.  Bring snacks & water if you can.  It's not really feasible to go a day without buying food, but cutting down on some snack purchases can save a ton over the day.  I usually put snacks in my backpack, and we keep bottles of water in our stroller's undercarriage.  For those without strollers or who don't want backpacks on all day there are lockers available as well (pre-children this was my preferred option).3.  Get you fast-passes.  Otherwise you can go to your local DMV for the in-line experience at no charge.4.  Use a ride wait app (MouseWait, Disneyland, etc).  There's several available for iOS and Android, and you'll appreciate their help5.  Bored?  Try looking for hidden Mickeys6.  Be prepared for large crowds, and expect to find it difficult to get around at times.  If you come into the park expecting the crowds they're usually a bit less frustrating.",5/5,6 years ago on  Google

9807,"I visited the park this summer with my kids, it was their first visit and they were disappointed of what they saw.. The disney characters weren't walking all around and we couldn't see any character .. The fast track system is very bad cause you can't have another one until you use the one you booked.. The lines were too long. .. Some Rides you can't feel the waiting time  but others you will hate the ride especially if you are waiting under the sun.. The castle was the most disappointing thing since it was too small and not like the one in Orlando .. The parade at night was amusing and the fireworks too.. I suggest checking the waiting time for each ride and if it's more than 45 min then you need to have fast pass for it.. At nigh the waiting time was less than day time.. The park in summer closes at 12 midnight so we had enough time to visit all the shops.. It's better to buy the tickets online and go early to enjoy everything..You need to chose a good spot to se everything.. Hope your kids would enjoy it more ..",3/5,7 years ago on  Google
